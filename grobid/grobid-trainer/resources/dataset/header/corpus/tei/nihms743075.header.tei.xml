	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> As a fundamental task, document similarity measure has broad impact to document-based<lb/> classification, clustering and ranking. Traditional approaches represent documents as bag-of-<lb/>words and compute document similarities using measures like cosine, Jaccard, and dice. However,<lb/> entity phrases rather than single words in documents can be critical for evaluating document<lb/> relatedness. Moreover, types of entities and links between entities/words are also informative. We<lb/> propose a method to represent a document as a typed heterogeneous information network (HIN),<lb/> where the entities and relations are annotated with types. Multiple documents can be linked by the<lb/> words and entities in the HIN. Consequently, we convert the document similarity problem to a<lb/> graph distance problem. Intuitively, there could be multiple paths between a pair of documents.<lb/> We propose to use the meta-path defined in HIN to compute distance between documents. Instead<lb/> of burdening user to define meaningful meta-paths, an automatic method is proposed to rank the<lb/> meta-paths. Given the meta-paths associated with ranking scores, an HIN-based similarity<lb/> measure, KnowSim, is proposed to compute document similarities. Using Freebase, a well-known<lb/> world knowledge base, to conduct semantic parsing and construct HIN for documents, our<lb/> experiments on 20Newsgroups and RCV1 datasets show that KnowSim generates impressive<lb/> high-quality document clustering.<lb/></div>
