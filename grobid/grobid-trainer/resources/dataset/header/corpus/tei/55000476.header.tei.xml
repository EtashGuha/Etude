	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT Activated components of the complement<lb/> system are potent mediators of inflammation that may play an<lb/> important role in numerous disease states. For example, they<lb/> have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory<lb/> joint diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To target<lb/> complement activation in immune-mediated joint inflamma-<lb/>tion, we have utilized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that<lb/> inhibit the complement cascade at C5, blocking the generation<lb/> of the major chemotactic and proinflammatory factors CSa<lb/> and C5b-9. In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of a mAb<lb/> specific for murine C5 in the treatment of collagen-induced<lb/> arthritis, an animal model for RA. We show that systemic<lb/> administration of the anti-C5 mAb effectively inhibits termi-<lb/>nal complement activation in vivo and prevents the onset of<lb/> arthritis in immunized animals. Most important, anti-C5<lb/> mAb treatment is also highly effective in ameliorating estab-<lb/>lished disease. These results demonstrate a critical role for<lb/> activated terminal complement components not only in the<lb/> induction but also in the progression of collagen-induced<lb/> arthritis and suggest that C5 may be an attractive therapeutic<lb/> target in RA.</div>

<div type="introduction"><lb/> Among the various factors that contribute to joint inflamma-<lb/>tion in rheumatic diseases, activated components of the com-<lb/>plement system may be considered to play a central role (1).<lb/> Products of the complement cascade mediate a wide range of<lb/> proinflammatory activities, including alterations in vascular<lb/> permeability and tone, leukocyte chemotaxis, and the activa-<lb/>tion and lysis of multiple cell types (2).<lb/> For example, there is long-standing evidence for intraar-<lb/>ticular complement activation in the pathogenesis of rheuma-<lb/>toid arthritis (RA) (3-9). Activated B cells and plasma cells are<lb/> present in inflamed synovium, and in established disease,<lb/> lymphoid follicles with germinal centers may be present as well<lb/> (10). This results in high levels of local immunoglobulin<lb/> production and the deposition of immune complexes (which<lb/> may include IgG and IgM rheumatoid factors) in the synovium<lb/> and in association with articular cartilage (11). Elevated levels<lb/> of activated complement components, such as C3a, CSa, and<lb/> C5b-9 (membrane attack complex), have been found within<lb/> inflamed rheumatoid joints (3-9), and positive correlations<lb/> have been established between the degree of complement<lb/> activation and the severity of joint disease (5, 7).<lb/> The C5 component of complement is cleaved to form<lb/> products with multiple proinflammatory effects and thus<lb/> represents an attractive target for complement inhibition in<lb/> immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. CSa is the most<lb/> potent anaphylatoxin and a powerful chemotaxin for neutro-<lb/>phils and monocytes, with the ability to promote margination,<lb/> extravasation, and activation of these cells (12). Cellular<lb/> activation by C5a induces the release of multiple additional<lb/> inflammatory mediators (13, 14). In addition, C5b-9 can also<lb/> stimulate the release of multiple proinflammatory molecules<lb/> (4, 6, 14) and may well play an important role in inflammation<lb/> apart from its lytic function. Thus, blocking C5b-9 as well as<lb/> C5a generation may be required for optimal inhibition of the</div>
