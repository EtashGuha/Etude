	<div type="introduction">Introduction.<lb/> It is not altogether easy to single out the dominant idea of<lb/> the present paper; perhaps this may be said to be the notion of a ir-series,<lb/> which is introduced<lb/> in Chapter I and recurs in Chapters II and III. Associ-<lb/>ated with this notion are the concepts of ir-nilpotent and of ir-solvable loops.<lb/> It would require too much space for precise definitions of these concepts<lb/> here. We may say, however, that 7r designates some &quot;characteristic&quot;<lb/> property which singles out certain elements of a given loop G; and that, by special<lb/> choices of ir, we arrive at the notions of a centrally nilpotent loop (analogous<lb/> to a nilpotent group), of a left-associatrally nilpotent loop (in which the role<lb/> of the centre in central nilpotency is now usurped by what we have called the<lb/> normal left associator), of a middle-associatrally<lb/> nilpotent loop, and so on.<lb/> When attention is restricted to loops with the inverse property, as is the case<lb/> in Chapter II, we have in addition the notions of Moufang nilpotency and<lb/> Moufang-central nilpotency.<lb/> Certainly the most useful tool introduced in this paper is the inner map-<lb/>ping group 3 of a loop G. When G is a group, $ reduces to the group of inner<lb/> automorphisms of G. In any case, 3 has the property of deciding normality;<lb/> a subloop H of the loop G is normal in G if and only if H is mapped into itself<lb/> by every element of $@BULLET But it is not true that 3 always consists of auto-<lb/>morphisms. In view of this latter fact it is necessary to learn a new technique<lb/> for the purpose of calculating with 3. A considerable part of Chapter I is in<lb/> fact devoted to the theory of the inner mapping group, particularly in connec-<lb/>tion with finite centrally nilpotent loops.<lb/> Another important tool is the autotopism group of a loop G. We say that<lb/> an ordered triple (U, V, W) of one-to-one mappings U, V, Woî G upon itself<lb/> is an autotopism<lb/> of G if and only if xU-yV=(xy)<lb/> W for all x, y of G. (The<lb/> autotopisms form a group under the multiplication<lb/> (U, V, W) (U\, Vi, Wi)<lb/> = (UUi, VVi, WWi).) As is shown in Chapter II, many interesting new struc-<lb/>ture theorems for loops with the inverse property may be derived with ease<lb/> by use of the autotopism group.<lb/></div>
