	<div type="abstract">Abstract In the present work we have selected a collection of statistical and<lb/> mathematical tools useful for the exploration of multivariate data and we present<lb/> them in a form that is meant to be particularly accessible to a classically trained<lb/> mathematician. We give self contained and streamlined introductions to princi-<lb/>pal component analysis, multidimensional scaling and statistical hypothesis test-<lb/>ing. Within the presented mathematical framework we then propose a general<lb/> exploratory methodology for the investigation of real world high dimensional<lb/> datasets that builds on statistical and knowledge supported visualizations. We ex-<lb/>emplify the proposed methodology by applying it to several different genomewide<lb/> DNA-microarray datasets. The exploratory methodology should be seen as an em-<lb/>bryo that can be expanded and developed in many directions. As an example we<lb/> point out some recent promising advances in the theory for random matrices that,<lb/> if further developed, potentially could provide practically useful and theoretically<lb/> well founded estimations of information content in dimension reducing visualiza-<lb/>tions. We hope that the present work can serve as an introduction to, and help to<lb/> stimulate more research within, the interesting and rapidly expanding field of data<lb/> exploration.<lb/></div>
