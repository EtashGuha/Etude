		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper describes a practical path planner for <lb/>nonholonomic robots in environments with obstacles. <lb/>The planner is based on building a one-dimensional, <lb/>maximal clearance skeleton through the configuration <lb/>space of the robot. However rather than using the Eu-clidean metric to determine clearance, a special metric <lb/>which captures information about the nonholonomy of <lb/>the robot is used. The robot navigates from start to <lb/>goal states by loosely following the skeleton; the resulting paths taken by the robot are of low &quot;complexity.&quot; <lb/>We describe how much of the computation can be done <lb/>off-line once and for all for a given robot, making for <lb/>an efficient planner. The focus is on path planning <lb/>for mobile robots, particularly the planar two-axle car, <lb/>but the underlying ideas are quite general and may be <lb/>applied to planners for other nonholonomic robots. <lb/></div>
