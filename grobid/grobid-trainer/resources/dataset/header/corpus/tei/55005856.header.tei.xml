	<div type="abstract">Infrared radiation is widely used in diverse technical<lb/> and scientific fields including spectroscopy, optical<lb/> communications,<lb/> and other<lb/> measurement applications. Through advances in photonics<lb/> technology, a wide variety of infrared detectors are<lb/> now available in order to meet a large range of<lb/> application needs.<lb/> Infrared detectors are classified into two categories â€“<lb/> thermal models and quantum models. A thermal<lb/> detector uses the energy of the infrared beam as heat,<lb/> while the quantum detector offers a higher detection.<lb/> Advances in research to better detect this part of the<lb/> higher spectrum have lead to the development of<lb/> more advanced detectors, including InGaAs<lb/> photodiodes, PbS &amp; PbSe photoconductive<lb/> detectors, pyroelectric detectors, and hybrid<lb/> detectors. While all of these devices are excellent at<lb/> light detection, each is better suited for certain<lb/> applications than others.<lb/></div>
