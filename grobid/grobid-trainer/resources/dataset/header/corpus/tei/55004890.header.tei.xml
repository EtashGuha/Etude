	<div type="abstract">Despite its vast utility in clinical oncology, the use of doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adria-<lb/>mycin) is limited by a potentially fatal cardiomyopathy. The following critical review,<lb/> which examines the natural course, histopathologic effects, risk factors and monitoring<lb/> indicators of this toxicity, also analyzes recent research of proposed mechanisms, in-<lb/>cluding free radical formation with depletion of detoxifying enzymes, inhibition of vital<lb/> enzyme systems and alterations in relative calcium concentrations. Prevention of the<lb/> adverse reaction has been attempted by using such agents as a-tocopherol, selenium<lb/> sulfide, coenzyme Q0o, sulfhydryl donors, nucleosides and razoxane, and via liposomal<lb/> carriage and alternative methods of administration.<lb/> </div>
	
	<div type="introduction">The immense value of doxorubicin hydrochloride<lb/> (Adriamycin) in treating a variety of solid and<lb/> hematologic malignant conditions is unquestioned. Its<lb/> usefulness is limited, however, by its cardiotoxicity, an<lb/> adverse effect of the drug that can preclude its use in<lb/> some patients and limit the duration of its use in many<lb/> others. During the past seven years, a number of re-<lb/>views have been published regarding this chronic and<lb/> often dose-limiting toxicity of doxorubicin, which un-<lb/>derscores its significance.&apos; 6 The deleterious effects of<lb/> doxorubicin on the heart can be categorized into acute<lb/> effects and a chronic cardiomyopathy; this review will<lb/> focus on the latter toxic effect.<lb/> The well-known chronic cardiomyopathy of doxo-<lb/>rubicin use greatly limits the usefulness of this broad-<lb/>spectrum antineoplastic agent. With the increased utili-<lb/>zation of chemotherapeutic agents as adjuvants to<lb/> surgical treatment and irradiation, there will be a<lb/> greater likelihood of more patients receiving cardio-<lb/>toxic doses of doxorubicin or even dying of this drug-<lb/>related toxic effect without evidence of malignant<lb/> disease. With this in mind, the need to identify risk<lb/> factors, to predict those persons capable of tolerating<lb/> further doses of the drug and to possibly prevent<lb/> cardiomyopathy becomes obvious.<lb/> Overview Prevalence<lb/> The overall prevalence of doxorubicin cardiomyop-<lb/>athy is 1.7% to 6.8%6-13 and is highly dependent on</div>
