	<div type="abstract">Synopsis<lb/> The progressive dissolution of carboxylated latex particles with increasing pH was utilized to in-<lb/>vestigate the internal structure of core-shell latex particles, in comparison with that of copolymeric<lb/> latex particles formed from the same monomers. The results indicated that in those latex particles<lb/> which are formed when ethyl acrylate (EA) -methacrylic acid (MAA) or methyl acrylate (MA) -MAA<lb/> mixture is polymerized in the presence of poly(MA-MAA) or poly(EA-MAA) seeds the shell is<lb/> composed of the more hydrophilic poly(MA-MAA) molecules relatively high in MAA content and<lb/> the core is composed of both poly(MA-MAA) and poly(EA-MAA) molecules, regardless of the order<lb/> of the stage feed, while the copolymeric latex particles are relatively uniform from surface to center<lb/> in distribution of all components except MAA. Examination of the distribution of the carboxylic<lb/> groups in all of the latex particles showed their concentration to be highest a t the surface and to<lb/> decrease with proximity to the center in accordance with other findings reported in the litera-<lb/>ture.<lb/></div>
