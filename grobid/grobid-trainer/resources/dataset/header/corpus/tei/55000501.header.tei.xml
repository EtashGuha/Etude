	<div type="abstract">Abstract: There are some technical difficulties in treating for a broad necked aneurysm and<lb/> a higher incidence of recurrence. Because of these drawbacks, more innovative techniques for<lb/> superior endovascular reconstructive treatment are required. We developed a novel covered<lb/> stent employing electrospinning to deposit fine polyurethane (PU) fibers onto stents. An<lb/> in vitro water leak test was designed and applied prior to animal testing to estimate the<lb/> performance of covered stents and to determine the appropriate amount of PU fibers on a<lb/> stent. Two tenths of a milligram of PU fibers proved to be sufficient to prevent water leakage.<lb/> Then, the efficacy of the covered stents to that of bare stents was compared using 10 rabbits in<lb/> which model aneurysms had been formed at the right common carotid artery by the elastase<lb/> method. Angiographic evaluation on day 1 posttreatment (acute phase) revealed complete<lb/> occlusion of the aneurysms and the patency of the parent arteries in animals treated with<lb/> covered stents. At 10 days poststenting (subacute phase), the aneurysm neck was completely<lb/> covered with neointimal layer as shown by scanning electron microscopic examination. The<lb/> PU-covered stent holds promise as a device for treating cerebral aneurysms. </div>
