	<div type="abstract">Abstractâ€” In this paper we focus on passive acoustic detection<lb/> and classification of divers with open circuit breathing systems.<lb/> We use a method that aims to find the fundamental breathing<lb/> frequency of a diver. For the analysis we have used data from<lb/> two different sea trials. One sea trial was conducted in a remote<lb/> area away from most anthropogenic activities and one sea trial<lb/> was conducted in the busy port of Gothenburg, Sweden. The<lb/> first data set is used to characterize the signature of the divers<lb/> with open breathing systems and tune the detection algorithm.<lb/> We estimate the detection performance as function of varying<lb/> signal-to-noise ratio levels. The detector is finally applied to data<lb/> from the second sea trial that was conducted in the port of<lb/> Gothenburg.<lb/></div>
