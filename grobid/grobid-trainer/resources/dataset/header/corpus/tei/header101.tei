		<div type="abstract">Abstract. Maximal word functions occur in data retrieval applications <lb/>and have connections with ranking problems, which in turn were first <lb/>investigated in relation to data compression [21]. By the &quot;maximal word <lb/>function&quot; of a language L , we mean the problem of finding, on <lb/>input x, the lexicographically largest word belonging to L that is smaller <lb/>than or equal to x. <lb/>In this paper we present a parallel algorithm for computing maximal <lb/>word functions for languages recognized by one-way nondeterministic <lb/>auxiliary pushdown automata (and hence for the class of context-free <lb/>languages). <lb/>This paper is a continuation of a stream of research focusing on the <lb/>problem of identifying properties others than membership which are <lb/>easily computable for certain classes of languages. For a survey, see [24]. <lb/></div>
