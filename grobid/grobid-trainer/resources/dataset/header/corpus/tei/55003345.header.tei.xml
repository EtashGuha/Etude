	<div type="abstract">Abstract In situ observations have shown that underground storage of hydrogen behaves<lb/> like a natural chemical reactor and generates methane. The mechanism of this generation is<lb/> the metabolic activity of methanogenic bacteria which consume hydrogen and carbon dioxide<lb/> and transform them into methane and water. The coupled mathematical model of the reactive<lb/> transport and population dynamics in a storage is suggested in this paper which also takes<lb/> into account the fact that the population growth rate depends on the structure of the bacte-<lb/>rium colony. The suggested system of equations is reduced to the Turing reaction-diffusion<lb/> model which proves the appearance of non-attenuating self-oscillations in time which are<lb/> uniform in space. These solutions are unstable and, once perturbed, generate regular spatial<lb/> stationary waves which correspond to the alternations of zones which are rich in CH 4 or CO 2 .<lb/> This result predicts the effect of a natural in situ separation of gases, which was observed<lb/> in practice. If the diffusivity of bacteria is neglected with respect to the effective diffusivity<lb/> of the injected gas, then only large-scale spatial waves arise. A low but non-zero bacterium<lb/> diffusivity causes the appearance of additional small-scale linear oscillations whose period<lb/> is the intrinsic parameter of the process and is proportional to the bacteria–gas diffusivity<lb/> ratio. The analysis is completed with numerical simulations of 2D problems and analytical<lb/> solutions of 1D problems obtained using the technique of two-scale asymptotic expansion.<lb/> The estimations for the parameters of the model were obtained.<lb/></div>
