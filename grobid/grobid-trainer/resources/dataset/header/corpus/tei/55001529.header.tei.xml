	<div type="abstract">Computer vision tasks are computationally intensive and repetitive, and they often exceed the real-time capabilities of the<lb/> CPU, leaving little time for higher-level tasks. However, many computer vision operations map efficiently onto the modern GPU,<lb/> whose programmability allows a wide variety of computer vision algorithms to be implemented. This chapter presents methods<lb/> of efficiently mapping common mathematical operations of computer vision onto modern computer graphics architecture.<lb/></div>
