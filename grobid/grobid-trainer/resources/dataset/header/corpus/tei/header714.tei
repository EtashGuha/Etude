		<div type="abstract">abstract: Building distributed operating systems benefits from the micro-kernel approach by allowing better support for modularization. However, we believe <lb/>that we need to take this support a step further. A more modular, or object <lb/>oriented approach is needed if we wish to cross the barrier of complexity that <lb/>is holding back distributed operating system development. The Chorus Ob <lb/>ject Oriented Layer (COOL) is a layer built above the Chorus micro-kernel <lb/>designed to extend the micro-kernel abstractions with support for object oriented systems. COOL v2, the second iteration of this layer provides generic <lb/>support for clusters of objects, in a distributed virtual memory model. It is <lb/>built as a layered system where the lowest layer support only clusters and the <lb/>upper layers support objects. <lb/></div>
