	<div type="abstract">We report a unique substrate for surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy ͑SERS͒ based on silver<lb/> nanoparticles-embedded silicon nanowires ͑SiNWs͒. The SiNWs were prepared by thermal<lb/> evaporation of SiO powder via oxide-assisted growth, oxide removed with HF, and then used to<lb/> reduce silver ions to form a highly decorated Ag-embedded surface. Such modified SiNWs<lb/> substrates yielded ultrahigh SERS sensitivity, which could detect 25 ␮l of 1ϫ 10<lb/> −16 M Rhodamine<lb/> 6G, 1 ϫ 10<lb/> −16 M crystal violet, and 1 ϫ 10<lb/> −14 M nicotine in methanol solutions. An Ag-modified<lb/> SiNW strand could also enable SERS detection of 25 ␮l of 1ϫ 10<lb/> −8 mg/ ml calf thymus DNA. The<lb/> possible mechanisms for the ultrahigh SERS sensitivity were discussed.</div>

	<div type="introduction">Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique to investi-<lb/>gate biological and chemical materials because it can provide<lb/> both rich structural and quantitative information in a nonde-<lb/>structive manner. It is widely recognized that Raman signals<lb/> can be readily enhanced by a factor of 10<lb/> 6 –10<lb/> 8 via proper<lb/> treatment of nanostructured metallic substrate for analytes,<lb/> coined as surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy ͑SERS͒.<lb/></div>
