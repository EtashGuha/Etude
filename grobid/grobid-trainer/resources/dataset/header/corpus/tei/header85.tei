		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Most data models and query languages, provide mechanisms for dealing with sets <lb/>of objects. Many applications nowadays, however, are list-oriented, i.e., deal with <lb/>collections or aggregates of objects in which their order is important. A formal model <lb/>and an algebra for representing and manipulating list-oriented data are presented in <lb/>this paper. We also give the criteria that were used in the design of the algebra and <lb/>show how the algebra satisfies these criteria. <lb/></div>
