		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The burstiness of variable bit rate traffic makes it difficult to both efficiently utilize network resources and provide end-to-end network performance guarantees to the traffic sources. <lb/>Generally, smoothing or shaping traffic sources at the entrance of the network reduces their <lb/>burstiness to allow higher utilization within the network. However, this buffering introduces <lb/>an additional delay so that, in effect, lossless smoothing trades queueing delay inside the <lb/>network for smoothing delay at the network edge. In this paper, we consider the net effect <lb/>of smoothing on end-to-end performance guarantees where a no-loss, no-delay-violation deterministic guarantee is provided with the D-BIND traffic model. We analytically quantify <lb/>these tradeoffs and provide a set of general rules for determining under which conditions <lb/>smoothing provides a net gain. We also empirically investigate these tradeoffs using traces <lb/>of MPEG compressed video. <lb/></div>
