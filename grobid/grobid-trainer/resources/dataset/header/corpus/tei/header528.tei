		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Multimedia has generated widespread interest in real-time support within general purpose <lb/>operating systems. Multimedia also places new demands on operating systems for interprocess <lb/>communication. The Multimedia Testbed is a set of applications that stress consistent low-latency response and efficient interprocess communication for large blocks of data. The <lb/>Multimedia Testbed was ported to Real-Time Mach in the hopes of providing predictable low-latency response and, consequently, good synchronization and low jitter as required for <lb/>multimedia applications. Our work compares the performance of Real-Time Mach with that of <lb/>Mach 3.0. Although the fixed-priority scheduling of Real-Time Mach is a substantial <lb/>improvement, user threads are still preempted by device drivers, and the overall real-time <lb/>performance is not suitable for multimedia applications. We discuss areas where Real-Time <lb/>Mach needs improvement. <lb/></div>
