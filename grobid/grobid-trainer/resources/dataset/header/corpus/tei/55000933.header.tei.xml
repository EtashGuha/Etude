	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> A RP-HPLC method has developed for simultaneous estimation of lansoprazole and domperidone in combined<lb/> capsule dosage form. Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor and used in the treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers<lb/> and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which the acid in the stomach washes back up into the<lb/> esophagus. Sometimes lansoprazole is used in combination with antibiotics to treat ulcers associated with infection<lb/> caused by the H. pylori bacteria, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer and Zollinger-Ellison<lb/> syndrome. Domperidone is indicated for treating symptoms associated with upper gastrointestinal motility disorders<lb/> caused by chronic and sub acute gastritis. It is a gastrointestinal emptying (delayed) adjunct, a peristaltic stimulant and<lb/> exhibit antiemetic properties.<lb/> The mobile phase used was a combination of Acetonitrile: Methanol (81:19). The detection of the combined dosage<lb/> form was carried out at 280 nm and a flow rate employed was 1 ml/min. The retention time for lansoprazole and<lb/> domperidone has found to be 2.8 and 1.57 min respectively. Linearity was obtained in the concentration range of 8-24<lb/> µg/ml of lansoprazole and 8-24 µg/ml of domperidone with a correlation coefficient of 0.9977 and 0.9992. Detector<lb/> consists of photodiode array detector; the reversed phase column used was RP-C 18 (2.27µm size, 250 mm´4.6 mm i.d.)<lb/> at ambient temperature. The developed method was validated according to ICH guidelines and values of accuracy,<lb/> precision and other statistical analysis were found to be in good accordance with the prescribed values. Thus the<lb/> proposed method was successfully applied for simultaneous determination of domperidone and lansoprazole in routine<lb/> analysis.<lb/></div>
