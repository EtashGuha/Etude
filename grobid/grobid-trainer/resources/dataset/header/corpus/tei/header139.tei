		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Nested loop execution of object-oriented queries retains <lb/>the promise of maintaining the full generality of the object paradigm, independent of the specifics of any single <lb/>object model. Thus, from this starting point we have <lb/>developed an object-oriented query optimizer and execution engine. The methods, developed to date for only <lb/>acyclic queries, augment nested loops structures with a <lb/>simple marking mechanism such that unnecessary loop <lb/>iterations are not repeated. In the case of acyclic queries, <lb/>the executions are asymptotically optimal. In contrast to <lb/>optimal query methods based on semijoin reductions our <lb/>method involves no preprocessing step and thus avoids <lb/>the extra I/O associated with semijoins and prevents the <lb/>formal benefits of semijoin reduction from appearing as a <lb/>practical improvement. Empirical results comparing our <lb/>query environment with a commercially available product <lb/>demonstrate significant performance improvement. <lb/></div>
