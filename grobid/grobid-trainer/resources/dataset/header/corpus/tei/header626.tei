		<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT <lb/>This paper describes and evaluates distributed <lb/>wavelength reservation protocols for all-optical WDM <lb/>networks. These protocols are essential for applying <lb/>WDM techniques to large scale all-optical networks. <lb/>The protocols ensure that the wavelengths on the links <lb/>along a path are reserved before communication takes <lb/>place. A message is transmitted using the reserved <lb/>wavelengths and remains in the optical domain utill <lb/>it reaches the destination. Based upon the timing at <lb/>which the reservation is performed, the protocols are <lb/>classified into two categories: forward reservation protocols and backward reservation protocols. Although <lb/>forward reservation protocols are simpler, our performance study shows that backward reservation protocols provide better performance. <lb/></div>
