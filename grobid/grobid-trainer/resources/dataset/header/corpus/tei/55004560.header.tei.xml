	<div type="abstract">Abstract-Male<lb/> New Zealand rabbits were kd diets containing either 0.27&quot;; cyclopropenoid fatty acids<lb/> (CPFA) or 05&quot;; cholesterol or both in combination. Compared with control animals, those receiving<lb/> CPFA tended to have higher plasma-and liver-cholesterol<lb/> levels and a higher incidence<lb/> of aortic<lb/> atherosclerosis. A similar pattern was seen when animals fed cholesterol and CPFA were compared<lb/> with animals fed cholesterol alone. The observed increases in liver cholesterol, plasma cholesterol<lb/> and plasma triglycerides indicated a wide range of sensitivity to CPFA. Some animals had plasma-cho-<lb/>lesterol levels eight to ten times as high as normal after feeding had continued for 3 wk. while others<lb/> showed only slight changes after 5 wk. Liver cells from all CPFA-fed animals had altered morphology<lb/> and often showed extensive damage.<lb/></div>
