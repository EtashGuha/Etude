		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>CC ++ is Compositional C ++ , a parallel object-oriented notation <lb/>that consists of C ++ with six extensions. The goals of the CC ++ <lb/>project are to provide a theory, notation and tools for developing reliable scalable concurrent program libraries, and to provide a framework <lb/>for unifying: <lb/>1. distributed reactive systems, batch-oriented numeric and sym <lb/>bolic applications, and user-interface systems, <lb/>2. declarative programs and object-oriented imperative programs, <lb/>and <lb/>3. deterministic and nondeterministic programs. <lb/>This paper is a brief description of the motivation for CC ++ , the <lb/>extensions to C ++ , a few examples of CC ++ programs with reasoning <lb/>about their correctness, and an evaluation of CC ++ in the context of <lb/>other research on concurrent computation. A short description of <lb/>C ++ is provided. <lb/></div>
