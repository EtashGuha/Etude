	<div type="abstract">INVENTION SUMMARY: We present a fortified rice product which is superior to existing rice<lb/> varieties because it combines nutrition, taste, and convenience. Developed by scientists in Cornell<lb/> University&apos;s Department of Food Science, this rice is the first rice product to have the same texture,<lb/> quality, size, taste, and kernel shape as polished rice, while also incorporating the greatly enhanced<lb/> nutritional content of brown rice. White rice, while valued for its palatability and shorter cooking time,<lb/> is devoid of nutrients and provides only empty calories. However, nutrient-dense brown rice has a tough<lb/> texture and requires double the cooking time. This rice offers the best of both varieties by providing a<lb/> product that has the texture of white rice and the nutrients of brown rice while requiring only a short<lb/> cooking time.<lb/> </div>

	<div type="introduction">POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This technology can be applied to enhance rice<lb/> products with a variety of nutrients, to create a nutritional, low-glycemic rice variety.<lb/> ADVANTAGES:<lb/> @BULLET The addition of fiber and micronutrients makes rice a better source of nutrients and a low-<lb/>glycemic food. Low-glycemic foods promote steady moderate blood glucose uptake in the blood<lb/> and reduce fat absorption during meal intake. Additionally, fiber reduces the total calories per<lb/> serving of rice by up to 25%.<lb/> @BULLET Unlike other fortification processes, the production process allows for micronutrients to be<lb/> evenly distributed through the kernel in any amount and combination. This process also allows<lb/> the rice to retain unprecedented levels of thiamin, iron, calcium, zinc, folic acid, vitamin A, and<lb/> vitamin C among other nutrients.<lb/> @BULLET Excellent kernel quality with the size, shape and color of conventional rice.<lb/> TECHNICAL MERITS:<lb/> @BULLET The fortification method used in this technology involves a low-shear extrusion process that uses<lb/> lower market value rice milling byproducts like broken rice and defatted rice bran.<lb/> @BULLET Supercritical carbon dioxide is injected into a mixture of rice milling byproducts and nutrients to<lb/> adjust the density and lighter color appearance of the rice.<lb/> @BULLET Other fortification methods are complicated and require special equipment. These techniques<lb/> often result in loss of texture and low levels of fortification.</div>
