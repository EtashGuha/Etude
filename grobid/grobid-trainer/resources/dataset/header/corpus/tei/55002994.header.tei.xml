	<div type="introduction">The STT® system is a combination of patented<lb/> processes and equipment for the manufacture of<lb/> chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The Innovator®<lb/> Series of reactors is well suited for pilot scale<lb/> production and process optimization.<lb/> The Innovator® 100 type reactor is designed for general early stage<lb/> research through development phase efforts where there is a need to<lb/> quickly identify and confirm the validity of a reaction as well as to obtain<lb/> significant amounts of product for testing and client evaluation. The<lb/> Innovator® 100 was developed to minimize the amounts of chemicals in<lb/> the reactor at any given time, so it is a good choice for applications where<lb/> the reactants are hazardous (explosive or toxic). Even though the reactor<lb/> is small, it has been constructed using the same design principles that<lb/> would be used for a commercial reactor, and processes can be easily<lb/> scaled to pilot plant through commercial sized production output.<lb/></div>
