			<div type="abstract">SUMMARY We consider panel count data which are frequently obtained
				in prospective studies involving recurrent<lb/> events that are only detected and
				recorded at periodic assessment times. The data take the form of<lb/> counts of the
				cumulative number of events detected at each inspection time, along with
				explanatory<lb/> covariates. Examples arise in diverse areas such as epidemiological
				studies, medical follow-up stud-<lb/>ies, reliability studies, and tumorigenicity
				experiments. This article is concerned with regression anal-<lb/>ysis of
				multivariate panel count data which arise if more than one type of recurrent event
				is of interest<lb/> and individuals are only observed intermittently. We present a
				class of marginal mean models which<lb/> leave the dependence structures for related
				types of recurrent events completely unspecified. Estimating<lb/> equations are
				developed for regression parameters, and the resulting estimates are shown to be
				consis-<lb/>tent and asymptotically normal. Simulation studies show that the
				proposed estimation procedures work<lb/> well for practical situations. The
				methodology is applied to a motivating study of patients with pso-<lb/>riatic
				arthritis in which the events of interest are the onset of joint damage according to
				2 different<lb/> criteria.<lb/></div>
