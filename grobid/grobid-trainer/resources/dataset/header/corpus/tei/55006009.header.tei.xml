	<div type="introduction">Stevia is a product ofthe pererurial plant Stevia rebaudiana,<lb/> native to north eastem Paraguay (Jt 1992). Stevia has a<lb/> sweetness 20H00 times that of sucrose for humans and is<lb/> used as a natural, low-caloric sweetener in some Asian<lb/> foods (Ju 1992). Stevia has the potential ofbeing used as a<lb/> feed additive in animal diets to increase performance by<lb/> increasing consumPtion.<lb/> Chickens have taste buds which resemble, but are not<lb/> identical to, those of mammals (Lindenmaier and Kare<lb/> 1959). In fact, the chicken has an acute sense oftaste (Kare<lb/> et al. 1957) though it does not correspond exactly with that<lb/> of humans (Balog and Millar 1989). The existence of taste<lb/> in the chicken has been established by their negative<lb/> responses to some flavours (Kare et al-1957). This study<lb/> was conducted to investigate the effects on weight gain and<lb/> feed consumption of incorporating different concentrations<lb/> of stevia into the broiler diet.<lb/> In a preliminary experiment, broiler chicks (Arbor Acres<lb/> x Arbor Acres) were housed in a battery cage for I wk to<lb/> determine the acceptability of stevia. Eleven different<lb/> groups were fed diets containing stevia ranging from 0% to<lb/> 0.085%. All experimental diets were offered ad libitum.<lb/> In the main experiment, 1000 male broiler chicks (Arbor<lb/> Acres x Arbor Acres) were randomly divided among 16 dif-<lb/>ferent floor pens (5.6 m2; with 62 chicks in each pen&apos; The<lb/> initial room temperature for the chicks was set at 30oC and<lb/> was reduced by 3oC weekly until 21oC was reached, which<lb/> </div>

The light inten-<lb/>sities were 30 lx for the first l0 d and 10 lx for the remain-<lb/>der of the experiment. The experimental design was a<lb/> randomized complete block of four blocks and four treat-<lb/>ments (diets). The four diets each contained a different<lb/> amount ofstevia added to a basal diet ofchick starter (days<lb/> I to 2l), grower (days 2l to 35) and nonmedicated finisher<lb/> (davs j51o aD.
