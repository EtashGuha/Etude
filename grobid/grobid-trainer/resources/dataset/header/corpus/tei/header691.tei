		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The increasing development of mobile networks raises new security requirements and concerns. <lb/> In addition to the basic need of authentication, confidentiality and key distribution services, a new pro- <lb/> blem involving privacy is the unauthorized tracking of users&apos; migration. In other words, accessing any <lb/>information related to the mobile user&apos;s location data without his consent, is a serious violation of his <lb/>privacy. Moreover, if no care is taken, the disclosure of the mobile user real identity may appear during <lb/> the authentication process. The basic solution to this problem is the use of aliases which insure non- <lb/> traceability by hiding the user&apos;s real identity and also his relationship with domain authorities. In this <lb/>paper we provide a classification of the different degrees of non-traceability and present a new efficient <lb/> method for the computation of aliases. This technique can be used during authentication of mobile users <lb/>and thus avoids the drawbacks of existing solutions such as GSM and CDPD. <lb/></div>
