	<div type="abstract">Given the many regional economic communities forming part of the eastern and southern Africa region,<lb/> it has not been possible so far to implement a true project of regionalisation. With SADC, COMESA,<lb/> EAC, IOC and IGAD in this part of Africa, there is potential to develop a common project for the<lb/> harmonisation of the whole region. To that effect COMESA, SADC and EAC have agreed to hold a<lb/> tripartite summit early in October 2008 to discuss the possibility of a common FTA with a view to<lb/> becoming a better integrated region in the future.<lb/></div>
