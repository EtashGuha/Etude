	<div type="abstract">Research by the Universities of Leicester and Surrey has found that playing classical music in<lb/> restaurants encourages diners to spend more.<lb/> Dr Adrian North and Amber Shilcock of the School of Psychology, University of Leicester, and<lb/> David Hargreaves, formerly of Leicester now at the Faculty of Education, University of Surrey<lb/> Roehampton carried out the study.<lb/> They spent three weeks monitoring the effects of classical, pop music and background silence<lb/> on spending and found that playing classical music made people feel more affluent:<lb/> When classical music was played in the background, diners spent an average of more<lb/> than £24 per head on food and drinks,<lb/> When pop music was played, less than £22 was spent by each diner,<lb/> When no background music existed, spending fell to £21.70 per head.<lb/> In the same test, diners were spending more than £1 each on coffee with classical music,<lb/> compared to only 80p with pop music and 54p without any background noise.<lb/></div>
