			<div type="abstract">IREM-1 is an inhibitory cell surface receptor with an unknown<lb/>
				function and is expressed on myeloid cell lineages, including<lb/> cell lines
				derived from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.<lb/> We have generated a series
				of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)<lb/> against the extracellular domain of IREM-1 and
				further<lb/> assessed its expression in normal and AML cells. IREM-1 was<lb/>
				restricted to cells from myeloid origin and extensive expression<lb/> analysis in
				primary cells obtained from AML patients showed<lb/> IREM-1 expression in leukemic
				blasts of 72% (39/54) of<lb/> samples. We therefore searched for specific IREM-1
				mAbs with<lb/> activity in functional complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)<lb/>
				and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Lead<lb/> mAbs against IREM-1
				showed specific cytotoxic activity against<lb/> a variety of AML-derived cell lines
				and freshly isolated blasts<lb/> from AML patients. Internalization of mAbs upon
				IREM-1<lb/> binding was also shown. In vivo anticancer activity of lead<lb/> mAbs
				was observed in an established HL-60 xenograft model<lb/> with a tumor growth delay
				of up to 40% and in a model using<lb/> primary human AML cells, where treatment with
				anti-IREM-1<lb/> mAb resulted in a significant reduction of engrafted human<lb/>
				cells. These results demonstrate IREM-1 as a potential novel<lb/> target for
				immunotherapy of AML.<lb/>
