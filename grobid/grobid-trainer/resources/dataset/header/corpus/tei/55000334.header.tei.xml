	<div type="abstract">Abstractâ€”This paper presents a common training signal design and<lb/> corresponding estimation methods for carrier frequency offset and<lb/> frequency-selective channels in MIMO OFDM systems. In designing<lb/> the common training signal, a training signal structure which yields<lb/> low complexity estimation methods is developed while the optimality of<lb/> the training signal is maintained. Frequency offset estimation is based<lb/> on the best linear unbiased estimation principle while channel estima-<lb/>tion is based on the least squares (also maximum likelihood) approach.<lb/> The proposed training signal and estimation methods can be applied to<lb/> systems with pilot-only training signals as well as those with pilot-data<lb/> multiplexed signals. The estimation range of the frequency offset can<lb/> be flexibly adjusted. The performances of the proposed methods are<lb/> very close to the Cramer-Rao bounds or theoretical minimum mean<lb/> square error.<lb/></div>
