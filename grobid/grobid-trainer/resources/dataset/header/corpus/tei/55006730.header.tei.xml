	<div type="abstract">In classical cryptography, a transposition cipher changes one character from the plaintext to another (to<lb/> decrypt the reverse is done). That is, the order of the characters is changed. Mathematically a bijective<lb/> function is used on the characters&apos; positions to encrypt and an inverse function to decrypt.<lb/> Following are some implementations.<lb/></div>
