	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The approach presented in this paper represents voice<lb/> recordings by a novel acoustic key composed only of binary<lb/> values. Except for the process being used to extract such keys,<lb/> there is no need for acoustic modeling and processing in the<lb/> approach proposed, as all the other elements in the system are<lb/> based on the binary vectors. We show that this binary key is<lb/> able to effectively model a speaker&apos;s voice and to distinguish<lb/> it from other speakers. Its main properties are its small size<lb/> compared to current speaker modeling techniques and its low<lb/> computational cost when comparing different speakers as it is<lb/> limited to obtaining a similarity metric between two binary vec-<lb/>tors. Furthermore, the binary key vector extraction process does<lb/> not need any hard threshold and offers the opportunity to set the<lb/> decision steps in a well defined binary domain where scores and<lb/> decisions are easy to interpret and implement.<lb/></div>
