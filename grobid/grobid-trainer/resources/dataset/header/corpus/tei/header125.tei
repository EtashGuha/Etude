		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory (HCIL) and the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) have <lb/>been working together to develop the ProgramFinder, a tool for choosing programs for a troubled youth from drug <lb/>rehabilitation centers to secure residential facilities. The seemingly straightforward journey of the ProgramFinder <lb/>from an existing user interface technique to a product design required the development of five different prototypes <lb/>which involved user interface design, prototype implementation, and selecting search criterion. While HCILs effort <lb/>focused primarily on design and implementation, DJJs attribute selection process was the most time consuming and <lb/>difficult task. We also found that a direct link to DJJs workflow was needed in the prototypes to generate the <lb/>necessary buy-in. This paper analyzes the interaction between the efforts of HCIL and DJJ and the amount of buy-in by DJJ staff and management. Lesson learned are presented for developers. <lb/></div>
