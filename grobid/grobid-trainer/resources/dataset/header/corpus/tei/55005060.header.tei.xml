			<div type="abstract">We describe Lagrangian measurements of water droplets in grid
				generated wind tunnel turbulence at a<lb/> Taylor Reynolds number of R  250 and an
				average Stokes number (hSti) of approximately 0.1. The<lb/> inertial particles are
				tracked by a high speed camera moving along the side of the tunnel at the mean
				flow<lb/> speed. The standardized acceleration probability density functions of the
				particles have spread exponential<lb/> tails that are narrower than those of a fluid
				particles (St 0) and there is a decrease in the acceleration<lb/> variance with
				increasing Stokes number. A simple vortex model shows that the inertial
				particles<lb/> selectively sample the fluid field and are less likely to experience
				regions of the fluid undergoing the<lb/> largest accelerations. Recent direct
				numerical simulations compare favorably with these first measure-<lb/> ments of
				Lagrangian statistics of inertial particles in highly turbulent flows.<lb/>
