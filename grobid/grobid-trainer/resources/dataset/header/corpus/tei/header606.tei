		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The case-based reasoning process depends on <lb/>multiple overlapping knowledge sources, each <lb/>of which provides an opportunity for learning. Exploiting these opportunities requires <lb/>not only determining the learning mechanisms <lb/>to use for each individual knowledge source, <lb/>but also how the different learning mechanisms interact and their combined utility. This <lb/>paper presents a case study examining the <lb/>relative contributions and costs involved in <lb/>learning processes for three different knowledge sources|cases, case adaptation knowledge, and similarity information|in a case-based planner. It demonstrates the importance <lb/>of interactions between different learning processes and identifies a promising method for integrating multiple learning methods to improve <lb/>case-based reasoning. <lb/></div>
