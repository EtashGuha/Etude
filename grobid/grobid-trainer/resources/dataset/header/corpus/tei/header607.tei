		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Several ways of improving the realism of the results <lb/>of traditional ray tracing are presented. The essential physical quantities of spectral radiant power and <lb/>spectral radiance and their use in lighting calculations <lb/>are discussed. Global illumination terms are derived <lb/>by employing illumination ray tracing for calculation of <lb/>quickly changing indirect lighting components, and ra-diosity ray tracing for slowly changing indirect lighting <lb/>components. Direct lighting is calculated during the <lb/>viewing phase allowing the use of bump maps. Finally, <lb/>a method is introduced that reduces the total number <lb/>of shadow rays to no more than the total number of <lb/>viewing rays for a given picture. <lb/></div>
