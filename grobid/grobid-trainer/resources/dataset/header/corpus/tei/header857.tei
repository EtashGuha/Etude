		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Mixed-initiative systems present the challenge of finding an effective level of interaction between humans <lb/>and computers. Machine learning presents a promising approach to this problem in the form of systems <lb/>that automatically adapt their behavior to accommodate different users. In this paper, we present an empirical study of learning user models in an adaptive <lb/>assistant for crisis scheduling. We describe the problem domain and the scheduling assistant, then present <lb/>an initial formulation of the adaptive assistant&apos;s learning task and the results of a baseline study. After this, <lb/>we report the results of three subsequent experiments <lb/>that investigate the effects of problem reformulation <lb/>and representation augmentation. The results suggest <lb/>that problem reformulation leads to significantly better accuracy without sacrificing the usefulness of the <lb/>learned behavior. The studies also raise several interesting issues in adaptive assistance for scheduling. <lb/></div>
