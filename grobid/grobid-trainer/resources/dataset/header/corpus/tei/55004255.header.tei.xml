	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> RHOADES (1941) found recombination in the proximal regions of chromo-<lb/>some 5 to be higher in male than in female flowers. Two explanations were<lb/> proposed to account for the lower female values, namely: (1) there is a basic<lb/> difference in rates o&apos;f crossing over in mega-and microsporocytes, or (2) selec-<lb/>tive orientation of the chromossome 5 bivalent o a the meiotic spindle leads to<lb/> the preferential segregation of noncrossover chromatids to the basal megaspore.<lb/> These alternatives have been tested by carrying out a half-tetrad analysis o&apos;f<lb/> the diploid eggs produced by plants homozvgnis fo: the rxessive e h g a i e ( e l )<lb/> allele. The A2-Bt crossover values determined from the diploid eggs of elon-<lb/>gate plants were much lower than those calculated from haploid sperm of both<lb/> El el and el el plants. Since male and female flowers should have similar cross-</div>
