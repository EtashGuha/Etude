		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Integrating persistence into an existing programming language is a serious undertaking. Preserving the essence of the existing language, adequately supporting persistence, and maintaining efficiency require low-level support from the compiler and runtime systems. Pervasive, <lb/>low-level changes were made to a Lisp compiler and runtime system to introduce persistence. <lb/>The result is an efficient language which is worthy of the name Persistent Lisp. 1 <lb/></div>
