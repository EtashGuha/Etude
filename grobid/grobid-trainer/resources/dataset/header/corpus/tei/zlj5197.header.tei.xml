	<div type="abstract">Purpose<lb/> Recent reports have suggested that 40% or more of National Cancer Institute (NCI) –sponsored<lb/> Cooperative Group phase III trials failed to achieve their accrual goals. We examine in detail the<lb/> accrual experience of the Cooperative Group phase III trials.<lb/></div>

	<div type="abstract">Patients and Methods<lb/> All Cooperative Group phase III trials activated from 2000 to 2007 were examined for their accrual<lb/> experience. For trials that stopped accrual with Ͻ 90% of their accrual goal, the reasons for<lb/> having Ͻ 90% accrual were documented. We focus on trials that ended with Ͻ 90% accrual<lb/> because of inadequate accrual rates rather than for other reasons, such as an interim monitoring<lb/> analysis by an independent data monitoring committee that stops the trial early because one<lb/> treatment is clearly superior.<lb/></div>

	<div type="abstract">Results<lb/> There were 191 trials activated from 2000 to 2007. We project that 22.0% of these trials will<lb/> have Ͻ 90% accrual because of inadequate accrual rates. We project that there will be 176,627<lb/> patients eventually accrued on the 191 trials (current accrual, 154,579) and that 2,991of these<lb/> patients will be on trials that have Ͻ 90% accrual because of inadequate accrual rates (1.7%). For<lb/> nonpediatric cancer trials, the corresponding percentages are 26.7% and 2.0%.<lb/></div>

	<div type="abstract">Conclusion<lb/> We find that insufficient accrual rates are not as high as previously reported and that only a small<lb/> proportion of patients were enrolled on trials that ended with insufficient accrual because of an<lb/> inadequate accrual rate. NCI has implemented new procedures to reduce the number of trials that<lb/> fail to reach their accrual goals and to minimize the number of patients accrued on these trials.<lb/></div>
