	<div type="introduction">Tyramide signal amplification (TSA)<lb/> 1 — sometimes called CARD, for Catalyzed<lb/> Reporter Deposition — is an enzyme-mediated detection method that utilizes the catalyt-<lb/>ic activity of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to generate high-density labeling of a target<lb/> protein or nucleic acid sequence in situ.<lb/> 2–6 The TSA method has been reported to increase<lb/> the sensitivity by up to 100-fold compared to conventional avidin–biotinylated enzyme<lb/> complex (ABC) procedures.<lb/> 4,7–13<lb/> Molecular Probes is committed to the extensive development of TSA in combination<lb/> with our proprietary dyes and other detection technology in order to achieve the ultimate<lb/> in high-resolution signal amplification technology in cellular and tissue applications.<lb/></div>
