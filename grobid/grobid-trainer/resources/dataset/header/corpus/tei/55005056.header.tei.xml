			<div type="abstract">Abstract Objective The aim of this research was to<lb/> assess the
				effects of a series of four training courses<lb/> comprised of 13 synchronous
				videoconferences on the<lb/> implementation of cognitive services in Spanish
				commu-<lb/> nity pharmacies. Setting A phone survey to continuing<lb/> training
				course attendants. Methods A random sample of<lb/> 225 pharmacists registered in a
				2004 videoconference<lb/> course was selected. The phone-survey questionnaire<lb/>
				included quality perception elements rated on a 5-point<lb/> Likert scale, and a
				series of questions used to identify<lb/> position in the Rogers 5-step
				innovation–decision model.<lb/> An algorithm was used to translate the questions
				into<lb/> Rogers' categories. To discover determinants of attendants<lb/> position
				in these categories, bivariate analysis, simple<lb/> correspondence analysis, and
				logistic regressions were<lb/> performed. Main outcome measure Position in
				Rogers'<lb/> diffusion of innovation steps regarding the adoption of<lb/>
				pharmacotherapy follow-up. Results The perception of the<lb/> course quality rated
				between good and very good for the<lb/> majority of respondents. A significant
				association between<lb/> having attended two or more of these four courses and
				the<lb/> Persuasion/Decision step in Rogers's model appeared. No<lb/> association
				was found between course attendance and the<lb/> Implementation/Confirmation step of
				patient follow-up.<lb/> Fifty percent of those who indicated they implemented
				the<lb/> service reported following-up with less than 10 patients,<lb/> and only 25%
				reported following up with more than 20<lb/> patients. Conclusions Although
				participation in these<lb/> courses was associated with higher steps in Rogers'
				model,<lb/> significant association appeared only with Persuasion/<lb/> Decision
				steps and not with the Implementation/Con-<lb/> firmation step, reflecting an
				attitude but not a performance<lb/> change.<lb/> Keywords Clinical competence Á
