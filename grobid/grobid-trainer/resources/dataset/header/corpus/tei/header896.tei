		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We present the spine calculus S !ffi&amp;&amp;gt; as an efficient representation for the linear -calculus !ffi&amp;&amp;gt; <lb/>which includes intuitionistic functions (!), linear functions (ffi), additive pairing (&amp;), and additive unit <lb/>(&amp;gt;). S !ffi&amp;&amp;gt; enhances the representation of Church&apos;s simply typed -calculus as abstract Bohm trees <lb/>by enforcing extensionality and by incorporating linear constructs. This approach permits procedures <lb/>such as unification to retain the efficient head access that characterizes first-order term languages without <lb/>the overhead of performing -conversions at run time. Potential applications lie in proof search, logic <lb/>programming, and logical frameworks based on linear type theories. We define the spine calculus, give <lb/>translations of !ffi&amp;&amp;gt; into S !ffi&amp;&amp;gt; and vice-versa, prove their soundness and completeness with respect <lb/>to typing and reductions, and show that the spine calculus is strongly normalizing and admits unique <lb/>canonical forms. <lb/></div>
