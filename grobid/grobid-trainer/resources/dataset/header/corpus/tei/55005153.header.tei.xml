			<div type="abstract"> Defining the links between cell division and DNA replication
				is<lb/> essential for understanding normal cell cycle progression and<lb/>
				tumorigenesis. In this report we explore the effect of phosphoryla-<lb/> tion of
				cell division cycle 6 (Cdc6), a DNA replication initiation factor,<lb/> by polo-like
				kinase 1 (Plk1) on the regulation of chromosomal<lb/> segregation. In mitosis, the
				phosphorylation of Cdc6 was highly<lb/> increased, in correlation with the level of
				Plk1, and conversely,<lb/> Cdc6 is hypophosphorylated in Plk1-depleted cells,
				although cyclin<lb/> A- and cyclin B1-dependent kinases are active. Binding
				between<lb/> Cdc6 and Plk1 occurs through the polo-box domain of Plk1, and<lb/> Cdc6
				is phosphorylated by Plk1 on T37. Immunohistochemistry<lb/> studies reveal that Cdc6
				and Plk1 colocalize to the central spindle<lb/> in anaphase. Expression of T37V
				mutant of Cdc6 (Cdc6-TV) induces<lb/> binucleated cells and incompletely separated
				nuclei. Wild-type Cdc6<lb/> but not Cdc6-TV binds cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1).
				Expression<lb/> of wild-type Plk1 but not kinase-defective mutant promotes the<lb/>
				binding of Cdc6 to Cdk1. Cells expressing wild-type Cdc6 display<lb/> lower Cdk1
				activity and higher separase activity than cells expres-<lb/> sing Cdc6-TV. These
				results suggest that Plk1-mediated phosphory-<lb/> lation of Cdc6 promotes the
				interaction of Cdc6 and Cdk1, leading to<lb/> the attenuation of Cdk1 activity,
				release of separase, and subse-<lb/> quent anaphase progression.<lb/>
