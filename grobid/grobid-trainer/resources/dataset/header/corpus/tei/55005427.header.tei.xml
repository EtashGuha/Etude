	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> In recent years, the demand on video analysis<lb/> applications [1, 2] such as video surveillance and<lb/> marketing is growing rapidly. A number of solutions<lb/> exist but they need to be evaluated. This point is very<lb/> important for two reasons: the proof of the objective<lb/> quality of the system for industrials, the possibility to<lb/> highlight improvement during research and thus to<lb/> understand better how the system works to improve it<lb/> adequately. This paper describes a new algorithm that<lb/> can evaluate a class of detection systems in the case of<lb/> frequent events; for example, people detection in a<lb/> corridor or cars on the motorways. To do so, we<lb/> introduce an automatic re-alignment between results<lb/> and ground truth by using dynamic programming. The<lb/> second point of the paper describes, as an example, a<lb/> practical implementation of a stand alone system that<lb/> can perform counting of people in a shopping center.<lb/> Finally we evaluate the performance of this system.<lb/></div>
