			<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The polystyrene prototypes were produced by selective
				laser sintering (SLS) rapid prototyping process. According to properties of
				thermal<lb/> depolymerisation of prototype material, the rapid manufacturing process
				for metallic parts was worked out through the combination of<lb/> rapid prototypes
				and precise casting technology. After prototypes burned out in precision shell
				moulds, a series of complicate thin walled<lb/> Al-alloy parts have been
				successfully made by vacuum differential pressure casting (VDPC) process. Accuracy
				of parts and influencing<lb/> factors were investigated and discussed. The process
				combines the advantages of producing high-qualified metallic parts with
				shortening<lb/> the period of production cycle.<lb/></div>
