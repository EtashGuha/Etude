	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Background: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of livestock that causes severe economic loss in<lb/> susceptible cloven-hoofed animals. Although the traditional inactivated vaccine has been proved effective, it may lead to a<lb/> new outbreak of FMD because of either incomplete inactivation of FMDV or the escape of live virus from vaccine production<lb/> workshop. Thus, it is urgent to develop a novel FMDV vaccine that is safer, more effective and more economical than<lb/> traditional vaccines.<lb/> Methodology and Principal Findings: A recombinant silkworm baculovirus Bm-P12A3C which contained the intact P1-2A<lb/> and 3C protease coding regions of FMDV Asia 1/HNK/CHA/05 was developed. Indirect immunofluorescence test and<lb/> sandwich-ELISA were used to verify that Bm-P12A3C could express the target cassette. Expression products from silkworm<lb/> were diluted to 30 folds and used as antigen to immunize cattle. Specific antibody was induced in all vaccinated animals.<lb/> After challenge with virulent homologous virus, four of the five animals were completely protected, and clinical symptoms<lb/> were alleviated and delayed in the remaining one. Furthermore, a PD 50 (50% bovine protective dose) test was performed to<lb/> assess the bovine potency of the subunit vaccine. The result showed the subunit vaccine could achieve 6.34 PD 50 per dose.<lb/> Conclusion: The results suggest that this strategy might be used to develop the new subunit FMDV vaccine.<lb/></div>
