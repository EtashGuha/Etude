		<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT <lb/>We present recent advances from our efforts in increasing coverage, robustness, generality and speed of JANUS, CMU&apos;s <lb/>speech-to-speech translation system. JANUS is a speaker-independent system which translates spoken utterances in <lb/>English and also in German into one of German, English or <lb/>Japanese. The system has been designed around the task <lb/>of conference registration (CR). It has initially been built <lb/>based on a speech database of 12 read dialogs, encompassing a vocabulary of around 500 words. We have since been <lb/>expanding the system along several dimensions to improve <lb/>speed, robustness and coverage and to move toward spontaneous input. <lb/></div>
