	<div type="abstract">The detection of chemical explosives is crucial for military and civilian safety. A confluence of<lb/> chemistry and engineering continues to improve the sensitivity for several classes of explosives,<lb/> and holds the promise of cheap and portable sensing. Optical and fluorescence-based sensors have<lb/> been extensively researched for portable applications due to their sensitivity and portability. This<lb/> tutorial review discusses chemical approaches to sensing explosives based on an optical readout,<lb/> and summarizes recent advances in fluorescence strategies, including fluorescence turn-on.<lb/> It is of interest to researchers working in the areas of materials chemistry or forensics.<lb/></div>
