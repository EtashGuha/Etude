		<div type="abstract">Abstract. In this work it will be shown, how the comparison of recursive program schemata (RPS) can be reduced to an only slightly modified <lb/>type of the search for maximal isomorphic subgraphs by interpreting the <lb/>RPS as directed, cyclic, labelled graphs. The quality of the mapping of <lb/>two RPS can be used as a quantitative measure for similarity of RPS <lb/>among each other. The simultaneously calculated graph morphism can <lb/>serve as a basis for the detection of analogies between the RPS. A special <lb/>neural net, developed for the solution of general graph-matching problems, realizes the search for a sensible and as comprising as possible <lb/>mapping between two RPS. It is shown, which special properties of RPS <lb/>have to be accounted for in the modeling and how these can be incorporated into the algorithms when using a special neural approach for the <lb/>solution. <lb/></div>
