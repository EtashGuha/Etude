			<div type="abstract">> Whilst the road transport industry has already started to<lb/>
				take advantage of the increased functionality offered by the<lb/> use of
				programmable electronic systems, the current Type<lb/> Approval mechanism, whereby
				all road transport equip-<lb/> ment is certified as being fit and safe for its
				purpose, cannot<lb/> adequately assess them. This paper describes the work<lb/> done
				as part of an EC DRIVE project to propose a European<lb/> standard for the
				development of safe road transport tele-<lb/> matic systems. In particular the
				philosophy behind the<lb/> software standard and its certification criteria, where
				most<lb/> of the new problems lie, is discussed. A solut/on is proposed<lb/> that is
				pragmatic, meaningful and workable.<lb/> safety-critical software<lb/> safety
				engineering<lb/> road transport<lb/> standards<lb/> It is now generally accepted
				that there is a number of<lb/> major problems associated with road transport,
				including<lb/> congestion, pollution, injuries and fatalities. These result<lb/> in
				a steady deterioration in the environment, and an<lb/> increasing cost on society in
				general and on individuals in<lb/> particular. In various parts of the First World a
				number of<lb/> major research programmes is now under way that are<lb/> attempting
				to tackle one or more of these problems.<lb/> These programmes have two things in
				common,<lb/> namely the use of radio communications and the use of<lb/> programmable
				electronics, often actual computers.<lb/> Applications that are being investigated
				include intelligent<lb/> cruise control, collision warning, platooning of
				vehicles,<lb/> automatic navigation (some with centralized control),<lb/></div>
