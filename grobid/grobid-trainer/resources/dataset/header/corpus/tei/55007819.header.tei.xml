	<div type="introduction">The Asian palm civet is a smaller<lb/> species of civet found throughout<lb/> the jungles of Asia, and easily<lb/> recognisable by its dark, coarse<lb/> hair and large eyes. The Asian<lb/> palm civet is also known as the<lb/> common palm civet and the<lb/> Toddy Cat is areas where the<lb/> Asian palm civet is natively found.<lb/> The Asian palm civet is found inhabiting the tropical jungles and<lb/> rainforests throughout much of Asia. The main populations of the<lb/> Asian palm civet however are found in southern India, Sri Lanka,<lb/> South-east Asia and southern China. Unfortunately, Asian palm<lb/> civets have been drastically affected by increasing deforestation<lb/> (and therefore habitat loss) in their native regions.<lb/> The Asian palm civet is widely spread and fairly commonly found<lb/> throughout much of Asia and despite their cat-like appearance<lb/> and behaviours, Asian palm civets are not felines at all but are in<lb/> fact more closely related to other small carnivores including<lb/> weasels and mongooses. Unlike other civet species the tail of the<lb/> Asian palm civet does not have rings, but the face of this species<lb/> is banded like that of a raccoon.<lb/> The Asian palm civet is solitary animal that only comes out under<lb/> the cover of night to hunt and catch food. These nocturnal<lb/> animals are primarily ground-dwelling and highly terrestrial as<lb/> they mark their ranges by dragging their anal glands along the<lb/> ground. Despite being predominately ground-dwelling though the<lb/> Asian palm civet is known to climb up into the trees either in<lb/> search of food or to hide from approaching predators.</div>
