		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>A novel approach to learning first order logic formulae from positive and negative examples is incorporated in a system named ICL (Inductive Constraint <lb/>Logic). In ICL, examples are viewed as interpretations which are true or false <lb/>for the target theory, whereas in present inductive logic programming systems, <lb/>examples are true and false ground facts (or clauses). Furthermore, ICL uses a <lb/>clausal representation, which corresponds to a conjunctive normal form where <lb/>each conjunct forms a constraint on positive examples, whereas classical learning <lb/>techniques have concentrated on concept representations in disjunctive normal <lb/>form. <lb/>We present some experiments with this new system on the mutagenesis problem. These experiments illustrate some of the differences with other systems, <lb/>and indicate that our approach should work at least as well as the more classical <lb/>approaches. <lb/></div>
