		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Quantum computing has witnessed a surge of activity recently owing <lb/>to some very exciting discoveries on both the theoretical and practical <lb/>fronts. In this overview, we sketch an account of the developments in <lb/>this scientifically intriguing field, starting in the early 80&apos;s when the first <lb/>questions about the computability of quantum processes were raised, <lb/>and which led to the formal definitions of a Quantum Computer and a <lb/>Quantum Complexity Theory. Peter Shor&apos;s recent remarkable discovery of quantum algorithms to solve the problems of integer factoring <lb/>and discrete log computing, which are believed to be extremely hard to <lb/>solve efficiently on classical computers, is a compelling demonstration <lb/>of the suspected superiority of quantum computing over the classical <lb/>model that is in use today. We discuss one of his algorithms and the <lb/>implications it has for classical cryptography. We discuss some of the <lb/>latest work in this field which has brought us yet closer to achieving a <lb/>physical realization of a quantum computer. Whenever it happens, if it <lb/>happens, it would be yet another revolution in the field of computing, <lb/>and maybe the biggest one to date. <lb/></div>
