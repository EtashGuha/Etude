		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper presents a new atomic commitment protocol, enhanced three phase commit <lb/>(E3PC ), that always allows a quorum in the system to make progress. Previously suggested <lb/>quorum-based protocols (e.g., the quorum-based three phase commit (3PC) [Ske82]) allow a <lb/>quorum to make progress in case of one failure. If failures cascade, however, and the quorum <lb/>in the system is &quot;lost&quot; (i.e., at a given time no quorum component exists), a quorum can later <lb/>become connected and still remain blocked. With our protocol, a connected quorum never <lb/>blocks. E3PC is based on the quorum-based 3PC [Ske82], and it does not require more time <lb/>or communication than 3PC. We describe how this protocol can be exploited in a replicated <lb/>database setting, making the database always available to a majority of the sites. <lb/></div>
