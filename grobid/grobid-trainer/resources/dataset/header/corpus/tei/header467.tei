		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Existing complexity measures from contemporary learning theory cannot be conveniently applied to specific learning problems (e.g., training sets). Moreover, they are typically non-generic, <lb/>i.e., they necessitate making assumptions about the way in which the learner will operate. The lack <lb/>of a satisfactory, generic complexity measure for learning problems poses difficulties for researchers <lb/>in various areas; the present paper puts forward an idea which may help to alleviate these. It <lb/>shows that supervised learning problems fall into two, generic, complexity classes only one of which <lb/>is associated with computational tractability. By determining which class a particular problem <lb/>belongs to, we can thus effectively evaluate its degree of generic difficulty. <lb/></div>
