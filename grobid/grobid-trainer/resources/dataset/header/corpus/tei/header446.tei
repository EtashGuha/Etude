		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Model-Based Optimization (MBO) is a paradigm in which an objective function is used to express <lb/>both geometric and photometric constraints on features of interest. A parametric model of a feature <lb/>(such as a road, a building, or coastline) is extracted from one or more images by adjusting the model&apos;s <lb/>state variables until a minimum value of the objective function is obtained. The optimization procedure <lb/>yields a description that simultaneously satisfies (or nearly satisfies) all constraints, and, as a result, is <lb/>likely to be a good model of the feature. <lb/></div>
