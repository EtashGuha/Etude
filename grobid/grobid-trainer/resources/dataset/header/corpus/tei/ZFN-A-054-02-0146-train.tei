			<div type="abstract">Biological informadon is coded in replicating molecules. To maintain a given amount of in- <lb/>
formarion a cooperative interaction between diese molecules is essential. The main problem for <lb/>
die stability of a system of prebiodc replicators are emerging parasites. Stabilization against such <lb/>
parasites is possible if space is introduced in die model. Complex patterns like spiral waves and <lb/>
self-replicating spot patterns have been shown to stabilize such systems. Stability of replicating <lb/>
systems, however, occurs only in parameter regions were such complex patterns occur. We show <lb/>
diat parasites are able to push such systems into a parameter region were life is possible. To <lb/>
demonsUrate diis influence of parasites on such systems, we inu-oduce a parasitic species in die <lb/>
Gray-Scott model. The growing concentradon of parasites will kill the system, and the cooperative <lb/>
Gray-Scott system will be diluted out in a well mixed flow reactor. While considering space, in the <lb/>
model stabilizing pattern formation in a narrow parameter region is possible. We demonstrate that <lb/>
die concen√ºadon of the parasidc species is able to push die system into a region were stabihzing <lb/>
patterns emerge. <lb/></div>
