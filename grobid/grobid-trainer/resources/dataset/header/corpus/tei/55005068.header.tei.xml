			<div type="abstract">Abstract—We consider the problem of maximizing the expected<lb/>
				sum of variables<lb/> chosen sequentially in an i.i.d. sequence<lb/> of length . It
				is equivalent to the following resource allocation<lb/> problem: machines have to be
				allocated to<lb/> jobs of value<lb/> ( = 1 . . .<lb/> ) arriving sequentially, the
				th machine has a<lb/> (known) probability to perform the job successfully and the
				total<lb/> expected reward must be maximized. The optimal solution of this<lb/>
				stochastic dynamic-programming problem is derived when the dis-<lb/> tribution of
				the<lb/> s is known: the optimal threshold for accepting<lb/> , or allocating the th
				machine to job , is given by a back-<lb/> ward recurrence equation. This optimal
				solution is compared to<lb/> the simpler (but suboptimal) open-loop feedback-optimal
				solution<lb/> for which the threshold is constant, and their asymptotic
				behaviors<lb/> are investigated. The asymptotic behavior of the optimal
				threshold<lb/> is used to derive a simple open-loop solution, which is proved to
				be<lb/> asymptotically optimal (<lb/> with fixed) for a large class of<lb/>
				distributions for<lb/> .<lb/> Index Terms—Dynamic programming, resource allocation,
