	<div type="introduction">HapMap Data Set<lb/> This data set contains the 270 samples from the International HapMap Project<lb/> (www.hapmap.org) run on the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. The 270 samples<lb/> are comprised of 30 CEPH trios, 30 Yoruban trios, 45 unrelated Han Chinese samples and 45<lb/> unrelated Japanese samples.<lb/> The Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 consists of 906,600 SNPs (or 931,946 SNPs in the full<lb/> version of the CDF file). As of HapMap release 21a, a total of about 828,000 SNPs have reference<lb/> genotypes available for at least 180 of the 270 HapMap samples shared here. These numbers are<lb/> steadily increasing with each HapMap update.<lb/> Chromosome X Titration Data Set<lb/> An additional collection of samples are of particular use for exploring copy number variation. The<lb/> copy number variation dataset consists of five replicates each of five samples. Three of the<lb/> samples have abnormal copies of the X chromosome, having three, four and five copies<lb/> respectively. The remaining two are a normal male and a normal female, but are of special</div>
