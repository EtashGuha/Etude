		<div type="abstract">Abstract. We study a method for parallel solution of elliptic partial differential equations which <lb/>decomposes the problem into a number of independent subproblems on subspaces of the underlying <lb/>solution space. Using symmetries of the domain, we obtain up to 64 such subproblems for a 3 <lb/>dimensional cube and the method reduces to a direct solver. In the general case, or when the <lb/>subproblems are solved only approximately, the method becomes an iterative method or can be used <lb/>as a preconditioner. Bounds on the resulting convergence factors and condition numbers are given. <lb/></div>
