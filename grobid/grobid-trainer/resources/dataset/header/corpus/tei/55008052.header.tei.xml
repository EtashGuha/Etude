	<div type="abstract">Interpretive Summary: The uncertainty in supply of petroleum based products and their unfavorable impact<lb/> on the environment has created a demand for eco-friendly lubricants. Vegetable oils are promising candidates<lb/> for eco-friendly lubricants, because of the advantages like naturally renewable resource, environmentally safe,<lb/> and good lubricity. Vegetable oils have some shortcomings like poor low temperature flow properties and<lb/> oxidation stability, which can be improved by chemical modification. The epoxidized vegetable oil and epoxy<lb/> fatty acid esters are important intermediates to obtain industrially significant materials, e.g. bio-based<lb/> polymers, emollients, chemical solvents, fuel additives, and lubricants. This paper presents a study of various<lb/> solid catalysts for epoxidation of unsaturated fatty acid esters. In this system, higher conversions were<lb/> obtained with higher amounts of catalyst, reactant, and concentration of the reactant solution. Product yield<lb/> increased with increasing surface area and decreasing surface acidity of the catalyst. The current approach<lb/> provides an alternative method to produce an important biobased intermediate, which will improve the<lb/> agro-economy of the locally grown renewable resource with new markets for soybean oil.<lb/> Technical Abstract: In this work we studied the catalytic activity of commercial alumina, and laboratory<lb/> synthesized alumina doped with Lewis acid metals, in the epoxidation of methyl oleate with aqueous hydrogen<lb/> peroxide. It was observed that the reaction yields increased when the amount of catalyst, the quantity of<lb/> hydrogen peroxide, the concentration of the hydrogen peroxide solution, and/or the surface area of the catalyst<lb/> was increased. Reaction yields were decreased when the surface acidity of the alumina was modified by doping<lb/> with Lewis acid metals.</div>
