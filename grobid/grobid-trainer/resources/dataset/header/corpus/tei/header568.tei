		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We introduce a new model of distributions generated by random walks on graphs. This model <lb/>suggests a variety of learning problems, using the definitions and models of distribution <lb/>learning defined in [6]. Our framework is general enough to model previously studied distribution learning problems, as well as to suggest <lb/>new applications. We describe special cases of <lb/>the general problem, and investigate their relative difficulty. We present algorithms to solve <lb/>the learning problem under various conditions. <lb/></div>
