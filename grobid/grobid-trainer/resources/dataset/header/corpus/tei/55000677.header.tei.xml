	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Deep packet inspection is playing an increasingly important<lb/> role in the design of novel network services. Regular ex-<lb/>pressions are the language of choice for writing signatures,<lb/> but standard DFA or NFA representations are unsuitable for<lb/> high-speed environments, requiring too much memory, too<lb/> much time, or too much per-flow state. DFAs are fast and<lb/> can be readily combined, but doing so often leads to state-<lb/>space explosion. NFAs, while small, require large per-flow<lb/> state and are slow.<lb/> We propose a solution that simultaneously addresses all<lb/> these problems. We start with a first-principles characteriza-<lb/>tion of state-space explosion and give conditions that elimi-<lb/>nate it when satisfied. We show how auxiliary variables can<lb/> be used to transform automata so that they satisfy these<lb/> conditions, which we codify in a formal model that aug-<lb/>ments DFAs with auxiliary variables and simple instructions<lb/> for manipulating them. Building on this model, we present<lb/> techniques, inspired by principles used in compiler optimiza-<lb/>tion, that systematically reduce runtime and per-flow state.<lb/> In our experiments, signature sets from Snort and Cisco Sys-<lb/>tems achieve state-space reductions of over four orders of<lb/> magnitude, per-flow state reductions of up to a factor of six,<lb/> and runtimes that approach DFAs.<lb/></div>
