	<div type="abstract">Abstract The ultimate goal of produced water management is to remove dissolved components and use the desalinated<lb/> water for beneficial uses that can effectively alleviate environmental impact and water shortage. Presently, many of<lb/> the efforts have been focused on membrane technologies including reverse osmosis and electrodialysis.<lb/> Unfortunately, no large scale implication of produced water desalination by membranes has been reported. The<lb/> main obstacle against the deployment of desalination technologies for produced water purification has always been<lb/> the complicated chemical composition and associated high operating cost. Membrane technologies are generally<lb/> believed to be energy efficient due to single-phase operation comparing to thermal-based desalinations. However,<lb/> the presence of dissolved organics and scale deposition on membrane surfaces require sophisticated pretreatment<lb/> and frequent membrane replacement, adding to the water treatment costs.<lb/> Reverse osmosis membranes including polymeric membranes and molecular sieve zeolite membranes were<lb/> investigated for ion removal from produced water by a cross-flow RO process. Considerable flux decline with<lb/> elapsed operation time was observed from 11.5 to 6.8 L/m</div>
