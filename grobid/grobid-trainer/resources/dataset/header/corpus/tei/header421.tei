		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The Xremote protocol is a compressed transformation of the X Window System protocol, <lb/>designed to efficiently implement X connections across relatively slow serial lines. Using an <lb/>Xremote simulator and 11 traces of X sessions, we found that Xremote&apos;s overall compression <lb/>ratio is 2.4:1. This figure varies widely depending on the trace. A study of compression <lb/>ratio as a function of message type shows text based messages commonly achieving 3:1 <lb/>compression, while geometric messages usually achieve only 1.6:1 compression. By examining bandwidth requirements and compression performance as a function of time, we see <lb/>that Xremote performs adequately for some applications which are text based or which use <lb/>small geometric datasets, except at application startup where more bandwidth is required. <lb/>Further work is required to adequately support the initialization stage of X applications and <lb/>medium to large geometric databases. <lb/></div>
