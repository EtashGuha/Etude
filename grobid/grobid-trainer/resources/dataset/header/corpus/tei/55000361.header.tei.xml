	<div type="abstract">Background: Hypercholesterolemia is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Orally administered chitosan binds<lb/> lipids in the small intestine and reduces their absorption. Chitosan has been shown to decrease serum cholesterol in animal and<lb/> human studies. This study investigated the effectiveness of chitosan in reducing serum cholesterol without concomitant diet<lb/> therapy.<lb/> Methods: Ninety female volunteers (age 34 – 70 y) with confirmed mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia were enrolled into<lb/> the study. They were randomly assigned to receive chitosan (1.2 g per day) or placebo in a double-blind manner. Serum lipids,<lb/> body weight and adverse events were assessed at baseline and after 28 and 56 days of treatment. Subjects maintained their<lb/> usual diet and documented the type and gross amount of food consumed.<lb/> Results: Eighty-four subjects (41 chitosan, 43 placebo) were included in the analysis. Chitosan significantly (F ¼ 3.19, P ¼ 0.04)<lb/> reduced total cholesterol compared to placebo. In a subgroup of subjects with over 60 y of age, chitosan group significantly<lb/> reduced total and LDL cholesterol (F ¼ 4.21, P ¼ 0.02, and F ¼ 3.46, P ¼ 0.04, respectively) compared with placebo. Adverse<lb/> effects were few; no serious events were reported.<lb/> Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that chitosan is safe and effective for lowering cholesterol. However, the effect of chitosan<lb/> for decreasing cholesterol is mild.<lb/></div>
