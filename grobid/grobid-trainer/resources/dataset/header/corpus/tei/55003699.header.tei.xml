	<div type="abstract">Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) aims to develop automated systems for the continuous monitoring, inspection, and damage<lb/> detection of structures with minimum labour involvement. The first step to set up a SHM system is to incorporate a level of<lb/> structural sensing capability that is reliable and possesses long term stability. Smart sensing technologies including the applications<lb/> of fibre optic sensors, piezoelectric sensors, magnetostrictive sensors and self-diagnosing fibre reinforced composites, possess very<lb/> important capabilities of monitoring various physical or chemical parameters related to the health and therefore, durable service<lb/> life of structures. In particular, piezoelectric sensors and magnetorestrictive sensors can serve as both sensors and actuators, which<lb/> make SHM to be an active monitoring system. Thus, smart sensing technologies are now currently available, and can be utilized to<lb/> the SHM of civil engineering structures. In this paper, the application of smart materials/sensors for the SHM of civil engineering<lb/> structures is critically reviewed. The major focus is on the evaluations of laboratory and field studies of smart materials/sensors in<lb/> civil engineering structures.<lb/></div>
