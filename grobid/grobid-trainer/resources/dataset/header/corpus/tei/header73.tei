		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>A novel approach to constant-magnification imaging is proposed. Magnification variations due to <lb/>changes in focus setting pose problems for important <lb/>vision techniques, such as, depth from defocus. It <lb/>is shown that magnification of a conventional lens <lb/>can be made invariant to defocus by simply adding <lb/>an aperture at an analytically derived location. The <lb/>resulting optical configuration is called &quot;telecentric.&quot; <lb/>It is shown that most commercially available lenses <lb/>can be turned into telecentric ones. The procedure <lb/>for calculating the position of the additional aperture <lb/>and a detailed analysis of the photometric and geometric properties of telecentric lenses are discussed. <lb/>The magnification invariance of telecentric optics and <lb/>its application to the problem of depth from defocus <lb/>are experimentally demonstrated in [ Watanabe and <lb/>Nayar-1995 ] . The proposed optics was found to result in significantly improved depth maps than those <lb/>obtained using a conventional lens. <lb/></div>
