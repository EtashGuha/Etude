		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>A search for charginos and neutralinos, predicted by supersymmetric theories, has been <lb/>performed using a data sample of 2.6 pb 1 at a centre-of-mass energy of p s =130 GeV and <lb/>2.6 pb 1 at 136 GeV collected with the OPAL detector at LEP during November 1995. No <lb/>candidate events were observed. The 95% C.L. lower limit on the lightest chargino mass <lb/>in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is 65.4 GeV if the universal scalar mass <lb/>m 0 is greater than 1 TeV, and 58.7 GeV for the smallest m 0 compatible with slepton and <lb/>sneutrino mass limits obtained at centre-of-mass energies near the Z peak. These limits <lb/>were obtained under the conditions that the lightest chargino is heavier than the lightest <lb/>neutralino by more than 10 GeV and tan fi is larger than 1.5. The results of a model <lb/>independent search for charginos and neutralinos are also given. <lb/></div>
