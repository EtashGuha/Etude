	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Model Driven Development is helping software de-<lb/>velopers rapidly engineer today&apos;s most sophisti-<lb/>cated business applications. Tool support, such as<lb/> the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and the<lb/> newly announced Eclipse Modeling Project, pro-<lb/>vide a variety of support to software engineers.<lb/> While these tools provide assistance during many<lb/> stages of the software lifecycle, few tools exist<lb/> to help the engineers design, generate and reason<lb/> about complex, data centric user interfaces.<lb/> This paper describes our Model Driven Visu-<lb/>alization framework. This framework allows the<lb/> Model Driven Development community to lever-<lb/>age several well established information visual-<lb/>ization techniques. Using model driven develop-<lb/>ment, we have provided a mechanism to rapidly<lb/> prototype new visualizations from an application&apos;s<lb/> data model. To demonstrate this approach, we<lb/> have used this framework to generate a number of<lb/> new, dynamically coordinated views for an EMF<lb/> model that summarizes almost a century of Na-<lb/>tional Hockey League statistics.<lb/></div>
