	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Touch screens are an increasingly common feature on<lb/> personal computing devices, especially smartphones,<lb/> where size and user interface advantages accrue from<lb/> consolidating multiple hardware components (keyboard,<lb/> number pad, etc.) into a single software definable user<lb/> interface. Oily residues, or smudges, on the touch screen<lb/> surface, are one side effect of touches from which fre-<lb/>quently used patterns such as a graphical password might<lb/> be inferred.<lb/> In this paper we examine the feasibility of such smudge<lb/> attacks on touch screens for smartphones, and focus our<lb/> analysis on the Android password pattern. We first in-<lb/>vestigate the conditions (e.g., lighting and camera orien-<lb/>tation) under which smudges are easily extracted. In the<lb/> vast majority of settings, partial or complete patterns are<lb/> easily retrieved. We also emulate usage situations that in-<lb/>terfere with pattern identification, and show that pattern<lb/> smudges continue to be recognizable. Finally, we pro-<lb/>vide a preliminary analysis of applying the information<lb/> learned in a smudge attack to guessing an Android pass-<lb/>word pattern.<lb/></div>
