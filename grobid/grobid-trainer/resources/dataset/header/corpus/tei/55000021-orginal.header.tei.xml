			<div type="abstract">a b s t r a c t<lb/> Mixed-mode chromatography is a chromatographic
				method that utilizes more than one form of inter-<lb/>actions between the stationary
				phase and the solutes in a feed stream. Compared with other types of<lb/>
				chromatography, mixed-mode chromatography is advantageous in its salt-independent
				adsorption, facile<lb/> elution by charge repulsion, and unique selectivity. Hence,
				it has already proved beneficial for the separa-<lb/>tion of proteins as well as
				other purposes. In this article, mixed-mode ligands for protein purification
				have<lb/> been reviewed. These ligands usually have an aliphatic or aromatic group
				as the hydrophobic moiety and<lb/> an amino, carboxyl or sulfonic group as the ionic
				moiety. Heterocyclic groups are good ligand candidates<lb/> for their unique
				hydrophobicity and dissociation property. Hydrogen bonding groups also have
				influences<lb/> on the performance of mixed-mode adsorbents. These principles should
				be considered in the screening<lb/> and design of mixed-mode ligands. Strategies for
				the design of synthetic affinity ligands, especially the<lb/> bioinformatics and
				combinatorial methods, may be adopted for mixed-mode ligand design. More
				efforts<lb/> are needed for the development of rational design and screening methods
				for mixed-mode protein ligands<lb/> by sophisticated computational and experimental
				approaches.<lb/></div>
