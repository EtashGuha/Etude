		<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT <lb/>Many operating systems have long had pseudo-teletypes, inter-process <lb/>communication channels that provide terminal semantics on one end, <lb/>and a smart server program on the other. We describe an analogous <lb/>concept, pseudo-network drivers. One end of the driver appears to be <lb/>a real network device, with the appropriate interface and semantics; <lb/>data written to it goes to a program, however, rather than to a physical <lb/>medium. Using this and some auxiliary mechanisms, we present a <lb/>variety of applications, including system test, network monitoring, <lb/>dial-up TCP/IP, and ways to both improve and subvert network <lb/>security. Most notably, we show how pseudo-network devices can be <lb/>used to create virtual networks and to provide encrypted <lb/>communications capability. We describe two implementations, one <lb/>using a conventional driver for socket-based systems, and one using <lb/>stream pipes for System V. <lb/></div>
