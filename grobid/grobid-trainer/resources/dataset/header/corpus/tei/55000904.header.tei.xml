	<div type="abstract">The 3p21.3 RASSF1A tumour suppressor gene (TSG) provides a paradigm for TSGs inactivated by promoter methylation rather than<lb/> somatic mutations. Recently, we identified frequent promoter methylation without somatic mutations of SLIT2 in lung and breast<lb/> cancers, suggesting similarities between SLIT2 and RASSF1A TSGs. Epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A was first described in lung and<lb/> breast cancers and subsequently in a wide range of human cancers including neuroblastoma, Wilms&apos; tumour and renal cell carcinoma<lb/> (RCC). These findings prompted us to investigate SLIT2 methylation in these three human cancers. We analysed 49 neuroblastomas<lb/> (NBs), 37 Wilms&apos; tumours and 48 RCC, and detected SLIT2 promoter methylation in 29% of NB, 38% of Wilms&apos; tumours and 25% of<lb/> RCC. Previously, we had demonstrated frequent RASSF1A methylation in the same tumour series and frequent CASP8 methylation in<lb/> the NB and Wilms&apos; tumour samples. However, there was no significant association between SLIT2 promoter methylation and<lb/> RASSF1A or CASP8 methylation in NB and RCC. In Wilms&apos; tumour, there was a trend for a negative association between RASSF1A and<lb/> SLIT2 methylation, although this did not reach statistical significance. No associations were detected between SLIT2 promoter<lb/> methylation and specific clinicopathological features in the tumours analysed. These findings implicate SLIT2 promoter methylation in<lb/> the pathogenesis of both paediatric and adult cancers and suggest that further investigations of SLIT2 in other tumour types should be<lb/> pursued. However, epigenetic inactivation of SLIT2 is less frequent than RASSF1A in the tumour types analysed.<lb/></div>
