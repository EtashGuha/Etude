		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In the design of algorithms, the greedy paradigm provides a powerful tool for solving <lb/>efficiently classical computational problems, within the framework of procedural languages. However, expressing these algorithms within the declarative framework of logic-based languages has proved to be a difficult research challenge. In this paper, we extend the framework of Datalog-like languages to obtain simple declarative formulations <lb/>for such problems, and propose effective implementation techniques to ensure computational complexities comparable to those of procedural formulations. These advances are <lb/>achieved through the use of the choice construct, that has semantics reducible to that of <lb/>programs with negation under stable model semantics. Then we extend the fixpoint-based <lb/>semantics of choice programs with preference annotations to guide search strategies and <lb/>simple logic-based formulations of classical greedy algorithms. <lb/></div>
