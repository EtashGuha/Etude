		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In this paper we develop a simple analytic characterization of the steady state throughput, as a function of loss rate and round trip time for a bulk transfer TCP flow, i.e., a flow with an unlimited amount <lb/>of data to send. Unlike the models in [6, 7, 10], our model captures not only the behavior of TCP&apos;s fast <lb/>retransmit mechanism (which is also considered in [6, 7, 10]) but also the effect of TCP&apos;s timeout mechanism on throughput. Our measurements suggest that this latter behavior is important from a modeling <lb/>perspective, as almost all of our TCP traces contained more timeout events than fast retransmit events. <lb/>Our measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predict TCP throughput and is <lb/>accurate over a wider range of loss rates. <lb/>This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grants NCR-95-08274, NCR-95-23807 <lb/>and CDA-95-02639.
