			<div type="abstract"> abstract<lb/> As the amount and the resolution of collected<lb/>
				scientific data increase, scientists are realizing the potential benefits that
				large<lb/> high-resolution displays can have in assimilating this incoming data.
				Often this data<lb/> has to be processed on powerful remote computing and storage
				resources, converted to<lb/> high-resolution digital media and yet visualized on a
				local tiled-display. This is the<lb/> basic premise behind the OptIPuter model.
				While the streaming middleware to enable this<lb/> kind of work exists and the
				optical networking infrastructure is becoming more widely<lb/> available, enabling
				multi-user interaction in such environments is still a challenge. In<lb/> this
				paper, we present an interaction system we developed to support collaborative
				work<lb/> on large high-resolution displays using multiple interaction devices and
				scalable,<lb/> distributed user interface widgets. This system allows multiple users
				to simultaneously<lb/> interact with local or remote data, media and applications,
				through a variety of<lb/> physical interaction devices on large high-resolution
				displays. Finally, we present our<lb/> experiences with using the system over the
				past two years. Most importantly, having an<lb/> actual working system based on the
				OptIPuter model allows us to focus our research<lb/> efforts to better understand
				how to make such high-resolution environments more<lb/> user-friendly and usable in
				true real-world collaborative scenarios as opposed to<lb/> constrained laboratory
				settings.<lb/>
