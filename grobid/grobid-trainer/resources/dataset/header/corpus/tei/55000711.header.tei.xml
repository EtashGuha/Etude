	<div type="abstract">Stability against nucleases, affinity for the targeted mRNA and the ability to recruit RNase H are<lb/> prerequisites for antisense oligonucleotide (AON) applications where gene expression knockdown<lb/> is required. Typically chimeric gapmer AON designs are used with a central continuous stretch of<lb/> RNase H recruiting nucleotides (e.g. phosphorothioate DNA), flanked by affinity and stability-<lb/>enhancing modified nucleotides. However, many types of nucleotide modifications in the central<lb/> DNA gap can disturb RNase H function. Here we present studies into two different types of<lb/> nucleotide modifications, a flexible acyclic RNA analog named unlocked nucleic acid (UNA) and<lb/> 4 0 -C-hydroxymethyl-DNA in the gap of an LNA (locked nucleic acid) flanked gapmer. We<lb/> compared the efficacy of mRNA degradation by the gap modified LNA antisense gapmers in<lb/> cell-free assays and cultured cells. This study shows that both UNA and 4<lb/> 0 -C-hydroxymethyl-DNA<lb/> gap insertions are compatible with RNase H activity when used sparingly. However, multiple<lb/> 4 0 -C-hydroxymethyl-DNA modifications are better tolerated by RNase H than multiple UNA<lb/> modifications in the gap. Furthermore, this report shows that LNA gapmer AONs with multiple<lb/> 4 0 -C-hydroxymethyl-DNA moieties in the gap can mediate target knockdown in vivo.<lb/></div>
