	<div type="abstract">The interaction between a single confined spin and the spins of a Fermionic reservoir leads to one of the most<lb/> spectacular phenomena of many body physics – the Kondo effect. In this talk, I will describe the first observation<lb/> of Kondo correlations in optical absorption measurements on a single semiconductor quantum dot tunnel-coupled<lb/> to a degenerate electron gas. In stark contrast to transport experiments, absorption of a single photon leads to an<lb/> abrupt change in the system Hamiltonian by turning off the exchange interaction between the quantum dot electron<lb/> spin and the fermionic reservoir, leading to a quantum quench of Kondo correlations. As a consequence of this<lb/> quench, the absorption line shape exhibits power law tails, signaling a redistribution of the optical oscillator strength<lb/> associated with an Anderson orthogonality catastrophe. We find that the power-law exponents characterizing the<lb/> quench are tunable by an external magnetic field, proving the link to spin physics. This observation, together with<lb/> the measurement of suppressed magnetization of the quantum dot electron, unequivocally demonstrate that the<lb/> observed absorption line-shape provides a direct of Kondo correlations. Our experiments arguably provide the first<lb/> example of many-body physics studied using a single optically active quantum dot.<lb/></div>
