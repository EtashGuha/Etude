		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Designers of embedded systems are facing ever tighter <lb/>constraints on design time, but computer aided design tools <lb/>for embedded systems have not kept pace with these trends. <lb/>The Chinook co-synthesis system addresses the automation of the most time-consuming and error-prone tasks in <lb/>embedded controller design, namely: the synthesis of interface hardware and software needed to integrate system <lb/>components; the migration of functions between processors <lb/>or custom logic; and the co-simulation of the design before, <lb/>during, and after synthesis. This paper describes the principal elements of Chinook and discuss its application to a <lb/>variety of embedded designs. <lb/></div>
