	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> The viability of yoghurt and probiotic bacteria was assessed during manufacture and 35 days storage of yoghurt supplemented<lb/> with four levels of ascorbic acid using four commercial starter cultures. There were no marked differences in titratable acidity and<lb/> pH of the yoghurt, whereas oxygen content and redox potential varied in yoghurts with various levels of ascorbic acid. Hydrogen<lb/> peroxide content was initially higher in the products prepared with starter cultures that contained Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp.<lb/> bulgaricus. During storage of yoghurt, increase in oxygen content and redox potential and percentage retention of ascorbic acid<lb/> were identical for all four starter cultures, but different at various levels of ascorbic acid. The oxygen content and redox potential<lb/> gradually increased during storage in plastic cups and remained lower with higher levels of ascorbic acid. Loss of ascorbic acid<lb/> occurred during manufacture and storage, with an average retention of only 1520% after about 35 days storage of yoghurt at 4Â°C.<lb/> The viable counts of Streptococcus thermophilus were lower, whereas those of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were higher, with<lb/> increasing concentration of ascorbic acid. The counts of Lactobacillus acidophilus during storage decreased less rapidly with<lb/> increasing concentration of acsorbic acid for all four starter cultures, whereas the counts of bifidobacteria remained unchanged. 0<lb/> 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.
