		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The problem of assigning m points in the n-dimensional real space <lb/>R n to k clusters is formulated as that of determining k centers in <lb/>R n such that the sum of distances of each point to the nearest <lb/>center is minimized. If a polyhedral distance is used, the problem <lb/>can be formulated as that of minimizing a piecewise-linear concave <lb/>function on a polyhedral set which is shown to be equivalent to <lb/>a bilinear program: minimizing a bilinear function on a polyhedral set. A fast finite k-Median Algorithm consisting of solving <lb/>few linear programs in closed form leads to a stationary point of <lb/>the bilinear program. Computational testing on a number of real-world databases was carried out. On the Wisconsin Diagnostic <lb/>Breast Cancer (WDBC) database, k-Median training set correctness was comparable to that of the k-Mean Algorithm, however its <lb/>testing set correctness was better. Additionally, on the Wisconsin <lb/>Prognostic Breast Cancer (WPBC) database, distinct and clinically important survival curves were extracted by the k-Median <lb/>Algorithm, whereas the k-Mean Algorithm failed to obtain such <lb/>distinct survival curves for the same database. <lb/></div>
