		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper presents a detailed comparison of the relative importance of allowing concurrent writers <lb/>versus the choice of the underlying consistency model. Our comparison is based on single- and multiple-writer versions of a lazy release consistent (LRC) protocol, and a single-writer sequentially consistent <lb/>protocol, all implemented in the CVM software distributed shared memory system. <lb/>We find that in our environment, which we believe to be representative of distributed systems today <lb/>and in the near future, the consistency model has a much higher impact on overall performance than the <lb/>choice of whether to allow concurrent writers. The multiple writer protocol performs an average of 9% <lb/>better than the single writer LRC protocol, but 34% better than the single-writer sequentially consistent <lb/>protocol. Set against this, MW-LRC required an average of 72% memory overhead, compared to 10% <lb/>overhead for the single-writer protocols. <lb/></div>
