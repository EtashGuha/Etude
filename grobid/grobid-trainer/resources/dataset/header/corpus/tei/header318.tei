		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper describes an experimental study of constraint-based network design. We used a <lb/>novel network design tool, implemented in Java, to design representative networks joining <lb/>major U.S. cities. The cost of three topologies: Best Star, Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), <lb/>and Delaunay Triangulation, are compared, with and without localized traffic constraints. <lb/>The best star network gives near optimal result when the traffic is only constrained by source <lb/>and sink capacity of switches (flat traffic constraints). With localized traffic constraints, the <lb/>most cost effective network has a structure similar to the MST. The cheapest network has a <lb/>tree structure when there are only flat traffic constraints, but can have cycles when localized <lb/>traffic constraints are present. <lb/></div>
