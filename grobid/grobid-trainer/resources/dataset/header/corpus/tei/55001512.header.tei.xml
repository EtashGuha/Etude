	<div type="introduction"><lb/> Moog called its Ethervox the &quot;world&apos;s first MIDI theremin&quot;. It is a fairly impressive instrument;<lb/> handcrafted mahogany cabinet, state-of-the-art circuitry, and that classic Moog theremin sound<lb/> together with MIDI control. Ethervox MIDI information is playable through the Ethervox itself or any<lb/> MIDI sound generator that can handle wide-range pitch bending.<lb/> Features of the Moog Ethervox include three pitch ranges. Tenor (two octaves above middle C,) Alto (3<lb/> octaves), and Soprano (4 octaves). The Ethervox can produce any pitch from subaudio frequencies to<lb/> the highest note of the selected range. The Etherwave&apos;s MIDI circuitry generates continuous pitch and<lb/> volume information, with pitch data transmitted as a stream pitch bend messages. The unit has<lb/> waveform, brightness, and filter controls and digital memory for storing customized presets.<lb/> Sadly, the Ethervox didn&apos;t have much time in the spotlight, and according to some reports there are<lb/> fewer than fifty Moog Ethervox owners. The Moog Ethervox is discontinued, but Moog continues to<lb/> offer support for the instrument at MoogMusic.com. You can find diagrams, a manual, and tech specs.<lb/> Here&apos;s a look at the Ethervox in action, courtesy of YouTube.com:</div>
