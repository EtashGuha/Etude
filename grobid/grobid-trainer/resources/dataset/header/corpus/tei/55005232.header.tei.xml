	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT Concrete is a kind of porous, particulate<lb/> composite material. The curing temperature and<lb/> environmental humidity as well as the internal moisture<lb/> content will affect the hydration rate of this<lb/> cementitious material. This study developed humidity<lb/> sensors using inexpensive plastic optic fiber (POF) to<lb/> record the internal relative humidity change of a<lb/> concrete specimen during curing period. The POF<lb/> humidity sensors were implanted into the concrete slab<lb/> to monitor its strength development. Several take-core<lb/> compression tests at scheduled dates were performed to<lb/> evaluate the relation among the maturity function of<lb/> concrete, the humidity profile, and the size of the<lb/> specimens. The humidity distribution of a concrete slab<lb/> was also compared with the theoretical calculation<lb/> from the diffusion equations.<lb/></div>
