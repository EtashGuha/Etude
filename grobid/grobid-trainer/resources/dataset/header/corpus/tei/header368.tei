		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Asymptotic tracking is studied for systems in which the relative degree is not well defined, <lb/>meaning that the control law derived from exact input-output linearization has singularities in <lb/>the state space. We propose a tracking control law which switches between approximate tracking <lb/>[1] close to the singularities, and exact tracking away from the singularities, and we study the <lb/>applicability of this law based on the behavior of the system&apos;s zero dynamics at the switching <lb/>boundary. As in [1], the ball and beam example is used to motivate the study. <lb/></div>
