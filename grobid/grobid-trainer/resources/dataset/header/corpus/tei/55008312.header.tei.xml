	<div type="abstract">Abstract. Massively deploying RFID systems, while preserving peo-<lb/>ple&apos;s privacy and data integrity, is a major security challenge of the<lb/> coming years. This is why research related to privacy-preserving authen-<lb/>tication is growing, including design of schemes, cryptanalysis and secu-<lb/>rity models. In nearly all such schemes secret key cryptography is used,<lb/> since RFID tags are extremely constrained in time and space, and un-<lb/>traceability is achieved by updating some data at each authentication.<lb/> Unfortunately, none of them entirely resists to denial of service attacks,<lb/> those in which the enemy forces updating of the tag and/or the reader<lb/> by sending fake messages. Moreover, literature lacks a clear and formal<lb/> way of comparing schemes w.r.t. this kind of attack. In this paper, we<lb/> introduce a new characterization, called synchronizability. This allows us<lb/> to, first, establish a relevant model; second, evaluate existing schemes in<lb/> this model and point out their deficiencies; third, present a new scheme<lb/> with all desired features.<lb/></div>
