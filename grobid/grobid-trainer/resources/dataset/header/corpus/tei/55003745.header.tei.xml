	<div type="abstract">Abstract: (1 → 3)-β -D-Glucans, a cell wall component in most microfungi, are suggested to play a role in the development<lb/> of respiratory and general symptoms in organic dust-related diseases. The mechanisms by which they induce these effects<lb/> are, however, not clear. In the present study, mediator release and its potentiation by the (1 → 3)-β -D-glucan as well as by<lb/> the (1 → 6)-β -D-glucan found in yeast and other fungi were therefore examined. Blood leucocytes from healthy volunteers<lb/> and from patients allergic to house dust mite were incubated with (1 → 3)-β -D-glucans with increasing 1,6-branchings: curdlan<lb/> [a linear (1 → 3)-β -D-glucan], laminarin and scleroglucan, and furthermore with pustulan, a linear (1 → 6)-β -D-glucan. Histamine<lb/> release was not observed on exposure to the glucans only, but in the presence of anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody or<lb/> specific antigens, all the glucans investigated led to an enhancement of the IgE-mediated histamine release. The glucans<lb/> induced a significant potentiation of the mediator release when present at concentrations in the range of 2–5 × 10<lb/> − 5 M.<lb/> These results suggest that (1 → 3)-β -D-glucan as well as (1 → 6)-β -D-glucan aggravates IgE-mediated histamine release.<lb/> Knowledge concerning the effects of glucans on immune responses may be of importance for understanding and treating<lb/> inflammatory and allergic diseases.<lb/> </div>
	
	<div type="introduction">(1 → 3)-β -D-Glucan is a cell wall component found in most<lb/> microfungi. In damp and mouldy buildings, the glucan has<lb/> been used as a putative marker of microfungal growth in the<lb/> examination of indoor mould exposure as a risk factor for<lb/> asthma and other adverse health effects [1– 4]. A relation has<lb/> been found between the indoor level of (1 → 3)-β -D-glucan<lb/> and the proportion of persons reporting symptoms indicative<lb/> of airway inflammation [1,2]. Upper airway inflammation,<lb/> verified by nasal lavage, has also been found in waste and<lb/> compost workers exposed to bioaerosols containing (1 → 3)-<lb/>β -D-glucan, endotoxins and fungal spores, indicating a<lb/> possible role of these agents in the inflammatory response<lb/> [5,6]. The ability of (1 → 3)-β -D-glucan to induce histamine<lb/> release has not been investigated, but the production of<lb/> cytokines upon exposure to (1 → 3)-β -D-glucans has been<lb/> examined in vitro . The results obtained indicate that (1 → 3)-<lb/>β -D-glucans induce the synthesis of IL-1, IL-6 and tumour</div>
