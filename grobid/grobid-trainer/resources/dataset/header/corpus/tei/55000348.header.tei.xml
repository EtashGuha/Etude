	<div type="abstract">Abstract: The entrapment of ␤-galactosidase (Escherichia<lb/> coli) in PLA and PLGA microspheres using a double emul-<lb/>sion technique resulted to significant reduction of protein<lb/> antigenicity. The extent of antigenicity loss depended on the<lb/> conditions of microsphere preparation. Most of antigenicity<lb/> loss occurred on the first emulsification step. Only the effects<lb/> of microsphere preparation factors having an important in-<lb/>fluence on protein antigenicity, such as the type of organic<lb/> phase (polymer solvent) and homogenization, could be pre-<lb/>dicted (on a qualitative basis) by antigenicity data obtained<lb/> after the first emulsification step. The type of polymer and<lb/> polymer solvent used to prepare the microspheres affected<lb/> ␤-galactosidase immunogenicity. The PLA microspheres<lb/> prepared using ethyl acetate was the most immunogenic<lb/> microsphere formulation, eliciting similar total antibody re-<lb/>sponses as the alum formulation of ␤-gal. This formulation<lb/> was the only microsphere formulation that induced an<lb/> IgG1/IgG2a ratio lower than 1, indicating an immune re-<lb/>sponse biased towards a Th 1 type. The results obtained<lb/> indicate that large protein molecules with complex tertiary<lb/> structure such as ␤-galactosidase can be entrapped in PLA<lb/> and PLGA microspheres with retention of protein immuno-<lb/>genic potential, providing that appropriate conditions of<lb/> microsphere preparation are applied, and that the formula-<lb/>tion of microspheres might influence the Th 1 /Th 2 type of<lb/> immune response against the encapsulated antigen.</div>
