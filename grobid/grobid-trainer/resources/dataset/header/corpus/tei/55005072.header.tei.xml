			<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> In this paper, we investigate some properties of
				nuclei and conuclei on residuated lattices and their concrete structures. By
				means<lb/> of nuclei and conuclei we give the respective characterizations for a
				residuated lattice reducing to a generalized MV-algebra and<lb/> a generalized
				BL-algebra. Based on studying regular commutative bounded integral residuated
				lattices, we introduce the concept<lb/> of a pseudo-dual quantale and investigate
				some properties of it, and prove that the set of fuzzy sets of a nonempty set
				equipped<lb/> with multiplication and negation operations is a commutative Girard
				quantale. Finally, we discuss the relationship between quantic<lb/> nuclei and
				quantic conuclei on a pseudo-dual quantale, and show that the quantic nuclei and the
				ideal conuclei on a pseudo-Girard<lb/> quantale are in one-to-one
				correspondence.<lb/>
