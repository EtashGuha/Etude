	<div type="abstract">Abstract. Gossip-based protocols have received considerable attention<lb/> for broadcast applications due to their attractive scalability and relia-<lb/>bility properties. The reliability of probabilistic gossip schemes studied<lb/> so far depends on each user having knowledge of the global membership<lb/> and choosing gossip targets uniformly at random. The requirement of<lb/> global knowledge is undesirable in large-scale distributed systems.<lb/> In this paper, we present a novel peer-to-peer membership service which<lb/> operates in a completely decentralized manner in that nobody has global<lb/> knowledge of membership. However, membership information is repli-<lb/>cated robustly enough to support gossip with high reliability. Our scheme<lb/> is completely self-organizing in the sense that the size of local views natu-<lb/>rally converges to the &apos;right&apos; value for gossip to succeed. This &apos;right&apos; value<lb/> is a function of system size, but is achieved without any node having to<lb/> know the system size. We present the design, theoretical analysis and<lb/> preliminary evaluation of Scamp. Simulations show that its performance<lb/> is comparable to that of previous schemes which use global knowledge of<lb/> membership at each node.<lb/></div>
