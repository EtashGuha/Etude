		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>DEVise is a data exploration system that allows users to easily develop, browse, and share visual presentations of large <lb/>tabular datasets (possibly containing or referencing multimedia objects) from several sources. The DEVise framework <lb/>is being implemented in a tool that has been already successfully applied to a variety of real applications by a number <lb/>of user groups. <lb/>Our emphasis is on developing an intuitive yet powerful set of querying and visualization primitives that can be <lb/>easily combined to develop a rich set of visual presentations <lb/>that integrate data from a wide range of application domains. While DEVise is a powerful visualization tool, its <lb/>greatest strengths are the ability to interactively explore a <lb/>visual presentation of the data at any level of detail (including retrieving individual data records), and the ability to <lb/>seamlessly query and combine data from a variety of local <lb/>and remote sources. In this paper, we present the DEVise <lb/>framework, describe the current tool, and report on our experience in applying it to several real applications. <lb/></div>
