		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The paper describes some geographical applications of a parallel GP code <lb/>which is run on a Cray T3D 512 processor supercomputer to create new <lb/>types of well performing mathematical models. A series of results are described which allude to the potential power of the method for which there <lb/>are many practical applications in spatial data rich environments where <lb/>there are no suitable existing models and no soundly based theoretical <lb/>framework on which to base them. <lb/></div>
