	<div type="abstract">Summary Sterculic acid, a A-9-desaturase inhibitor, administered to rats caused a rise in the stearic:oleic acid<lb/> ratio of total lipids in peripheral red cells, serum and liver (P &lt;0.001). As a reduction in the stearic:oleic acid<lb/> ratio has been described in cancer cells, we investigated the effect of sterculic acid on tumour growth. Female<lb/> F344 rats were injected subcutaneously with two different doses of sterculic acid for 4 weeks prior to, and 4<lb/> weeks following, implantation of a nitrosomethylurea-induced mammary tumour. Tumour growth was<lb/> inhibited equally by the two doses of sterculic acid (P &lt;0.001). A rise in the stearic:oleic acid ratio of tumours<lb/> was observed in rats treated for only 16 days with sterculic acid. Manipulation of the tissue stearic:oleic acid<lb/> ratio inhibits transplanted mammary tumour growth in rats.<lb/> </div>
	
	<div type="introduction">Fats have long been linked to cancer promotion.<lb/> Epidemiological studies have shown that dietary factors, and<lb/> in particular fat, are linked to several cancers including<lb/> breast and colon cancer (Segi et al., 1966; Drasar &amp;<lb/> Irving, 1973). Monounsaturated, saturated and polyun-<lb/>saturated fats were found to correlate with breast cancer<lb/> incidence in a case control study (Miller et al., 1978).<lb/> Although such studies do not demonstrate a strong link with<lb/> any particular type of fat, experimental models of several<lb/> cancers, including colon and breast cancer, have shown that<lb/> polyunsaturated fats are more potent promoters of mammary<lb/> cancer than saturated fats (Carroll &amp; Khor, 1971; Rao &amp;<lb/> Abraham, 1976). The relative tissue content of saturated and<lb/> unsaturated fatty acid may be important in tumour promo-<lb/>tion. When individual fatty acids were investigated, linoleate<lb/> and oleate increased the growth of nitrosomethylurea-<lb/>induced mammary tumour in vivo (Chan et al., 1983). By<lb/> contrast, stearic acid inhibited mammary tumour cells in vitro</div>
