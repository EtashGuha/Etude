		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Subdivision surfaces provide a curved surface representation that is useful in a number of applications, including modeling surfaces of arbitrary topological type [5] , fitting scattered data [6] , and geometric compression <lb/>and automatic level-of-detail generation using wavelets [8] . Subdivision surfaces also provide an attractive representation for fast rendering, since they can directly represent complex surfaces of arbitrary topology. This direct <lb/>representation contrasts with traditional approaches such as trimmed NURBS, in which tesselating trim regions <lb/>dominates rendering time, and algebraic implicit surfaces, in which rendering requires resultants, root finders, or <lb/>other computationally expensive techniques. <lb/>We present a method for subdivision surface triangulation that is fast, uses minimum memory, and is simpler in <lb/>structure than a naive rendering method based on direct subdivision. These features make the algorithm amenable <lb/>to implementation on dedicated geometry engine processors, allowing high rendering performance on appropri <lb/>ately equipped graphics hardware. <lb/></div>
