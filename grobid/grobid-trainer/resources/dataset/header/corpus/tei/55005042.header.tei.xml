				a b s t r a c t<lb/>
				The most common problem in vertical transportation using elevator group appears when a passenger<lb/>
				wants to travel from a floor to other different floor in a building. The passenger makes a hall call by<lb/>
				pressing a landing call button installed at the floor and located near the cars of the elevator group. After<lb/>
				that, the elevator controller receives the call and identifies which one of the elevators in the group is most<lb/>
				suitable to serve the person having issued the call. In this paper, we have developed different elevator<lb/>
				group controllers based on genetic and tabu search algorithms. Even though genetic algorithm has been<lb/>
				previously considered in vertical transportation problems, the use of tabu search approaches is a novelty<lb/>
				in vertical transportation and has not been considered previously. Tests have been carried out for high-rise<lb/>
				buildings considering diverse sizes in the group of cars. Results indicate that the waiting time and journey<lb/>
				time of passengers were significantly improved when dealing with such soft computing approaches. Also,<lb/>
				a quickly evaluable solution quality function in the algorithms allows suitable computational times for<lb/>
				industry implementation.<lb/>
