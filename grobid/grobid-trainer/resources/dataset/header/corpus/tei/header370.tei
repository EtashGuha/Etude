		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Using linguistic variables to describe the behavior of a <lb/>hybrid system, which consists of a discrete event system and a continuous system, could make the design <lb/>of the controller and verification of the system perform <lb/>on an unified framework. In this paper, we show the <lb/>construction of a fuzzy linguistic model from a given <lb/>mathematical model of a physical system. By considering the state-space realization of the model, the system <lb/>construction problem can be transformed into a function approximation problem. We propose to use projection theorem in obtaining an optimal fuzzy system <lb/>which is the best approximation of a given nonlinear <lb/>function in L 2 (U ) space. We show that the existence <lb/>and uniqueness of the optimal solution is assured when <lb/>the Fuzzy Basis Functions(FBFs) are linearly independent. We demonstrate that the dependence of the basis <lb/>functions can be examined by checking the condition of <lb/>the Gram determinant associated to the FBFs. Finally, <lb/>a method is proposed in converting the optimal coefficients into fuzzy sets to obtain a fuzzy linguistic model. <lb/></div>
