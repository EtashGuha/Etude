	<titlePart>Linux System Call Table<lb/></titlePart>
	</docTitle>

	<div type="abstract">The following table lists the system calls for the Linux 2.2 kernel. It could also be thought of as an API for the interface between<lb/> user space and kernel space. My motivation for making this table was to make programming in assembly language easier when<lb/> using only system calls and not the C library (for more information on this topic, go to http://www.linuxassembly.org). On the left<lb/> are the numbers of the system calls. This number will be put in register %eax. On the right of the table are the types of values to be<lb/> put into the remaining registers before calling the software interrupt &apos;int 0x80&apos;. After each syscall, an integer is returned in %eax.<lb/></div>
