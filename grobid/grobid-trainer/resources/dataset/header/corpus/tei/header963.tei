		<div type="abstract">Abstract: <lb/> Lawsuits, and from a general point of view the act of judging, are fascinating phenomena&apos;s. <lb/> Justice can often be found at the core of our passions as a sacred and ritual activity. As well <lb/> as death rituals, judicial rituals are to be found in every organised society sharing links with <lb/> the divine or sacred things. This deep rooted sacred element ensures the authority of the <lb/> judicial institution and of its discourse. The judge represents God and is the only one to <lb/> possess the power to announce the truth. The passage from tradition to modernity and post <lb/> modernity characterized by the dominance of the principle of reason may weaken the <lb/> discourse of the judicial institution. Because of its rationalization, it is now competing against <lb/> other kinds of discourse and especially those of politicians. Just like other social institutions, <lb/> the judicial institution is particularly confronted with the post modern problems of the meaning <lb/> and representation. <lb/></div>
