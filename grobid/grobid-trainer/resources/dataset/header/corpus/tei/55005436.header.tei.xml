	<div type="introduction">In computer science and information science, an<lb/> ontology is a formal representation of the knowledge<lb/> by a set of concepts within a domain and the<lb/> relationships between those concepts. It is used to<lb/> reason about the properties of that domain, and may<lb/> be used to describe the domain.<lb/> In theory, an ontology is a &quot;formal, explicit<lb/> specification of a shared conceptualisation&quot;.<lb/> [1] An<lb/> ontology provides a shared vocabulary, which can be<lb/> used to model a domain — that is, the type of objects<lb/> and/or concepts that exist, and their properties and<lb/> relations.<lb/> [2]<lb/> Ontologies are used in artificial intelligence, the Semantic Web, systems engineering, software engineering,<lb/> biomedical informatics, library science, enterprise bookmarking, and information architecture as a form of<lb/> knowledge representation about the world or some part of it. The creation of domain ontologies is also<lb/> fundamental to the definition and use of an enterprise architecture framework.<lb/></div>
