		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This report outlines the IPUS paradigm, named for Integrated Processing and Understanding of Signals, which permits sophisticated interaction between theory-based problem <lb/>solving in signal processing and heuristic problem-solving in signal interpretation. The need <lb/>for such a paradigm arises in signal understanding domains that require the processing of <lb/>complicated interacting signals under variable signal-to-noise ratios. One such application is <lb/>sound understanding, in the context of which we report on a testbed experiment illustrating <lb/>the functionality of key IPUS architecture components. <lb/></div>
