		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper attempts to raise some issues that <lb/>are important for graduate students to be successful and to get as much out of the process <lb/>as possible, and for advisors who wish to help <lb/>their students be successful. The intent is not <lb/>to provide prescriptive advice no formulas for <lb/>finishing a thesis or twelve-step programs for becoming a better advisor are given but to raise <lb/>awareness on both sides of the advisor-student <lb/>relationship as to what the expectations are and <lb/>should be for this relationship, what a graduate <lb/>student should expect to accomplish, common <lb/>problems, and where to go if the advisor is not <lb/>forthcoming. <lb/></div>
