		<div type="abstract">Abstract | The purpose of this note is to present a new sampling technique and to demonstrate <lb/>some of its properties. The new technique consists of picking two elements at random, and deterministically generating (from them) a long sequence of pairwise independent elements. The <lb/>sequence is guarantees to intersect, with high probability, any set of non-negligible density. <lb/></div>
