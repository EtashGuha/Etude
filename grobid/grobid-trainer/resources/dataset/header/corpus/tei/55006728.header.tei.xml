	<div type="introduction">In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as a<lb/> Caesar&apos;s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar&apos;s Code or<lb/> Caesar Shift, is one of the simplest and most<lb/> widely-known encryption techniques. It is a type of<lb/> substitution cipher in which each letter in the<lb/> plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of<lb/> positions further down the alphabet. For example,<lb/> with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would<lb/> become E, and so on. The method is named after<lb/> Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his<lb/> generals.<lb/> The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is<lb/> often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher, and still has modern<lb/> application in the ROT13 system. As with all single alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily<lb/> broken and in practice offers essentially no communication security.<lb/></div>
