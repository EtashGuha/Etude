	<div type="introduction"><lb/> Thrombosis and obstetric complications occurring in patients<lb/> with anti-phospholipid antibodies define the anti-phospholipid<lb/> syndrome (Godfrey &amp; D&apos;Cruz, 2000). Over the last decade, it has<lb/> become clear that antiphospholipid antibodies are not directed<lb/> against phospholipids, but recognize lipid-bound plasma pro-<lb/>teins. The most common antigenic targets of anti-phospholipid<lb/> antibodies are b 2 -glycoprotein I (b 2 GPI) and prothrombin.<lb/> Anti-b 2 GPI antibodies are usually identified as &apos;anticardiolipin&apos;<lb/> antibodies, because they react with cardiolipin in immunoas-<lb/>says, provided b 2 GPI is present (Galli et al, 1990; Matsuura<lb/> et al, 1990; McNeil et al, 1990). In subgroups of patients with<lb/> anti-b 2 GPI antibodies, anti-prothrombin antibodies or both,<lb/> lupus anticoagulant activity is found (Bevers et al, 1991; Galli<lb/> et al, 1992 and 1997; Oosting et al, 1992; Permpikul et al, 1994).<lb/> The protein C pathway causes a negative feedback of blood<lb/> coagulation through proteolytic inactivation of factor Va<lb/> (FVa) and factor VIIIa (FVIIIa); quantitative and/or qualitative<lb/> abnormalities of this pathway are associated with an increased<lb/> risk of venous thrombosis (Esmon, 2000). Since the late 1980s,<lb/> interference of anti-phospholipid antibodies with the antico-<lb/>agulant activity of this pathway has been investigated as one of<lb/> the possible causes of thrombosis in patients with the anti-<lb/>phospholipid syndrome. Anti-phospholipid antibodies have<lb/> been reported to inhibit both the activation of protein C<lb/> (Keeling et al, 1993; Toyoshima et al, 1993) and the activated<lb/> protein C (APC)-catalysed inactivation of FVa (Freyssinet &amp;<lb/> Cazenave, 1987; Marciniak &amp; Romond, 1989; Lo et al, 1990;<lb/> Malia et al, 1990; Borrell et al, 1992; Matsuda et al, 1995;<lb/> Smirnov et al, 1995; Galli et al, 1998; Ieko et al, 1999; Field<lb/> et al, 2000; Izumi et al, 2002; Nojima et al, 2002). In partic-<lb/>ular, plasmas or IgG fractions with lupus anticoagulant activity<lb/> exert this effect, which has been named &apos;acquired&apos; resistance to<lb/> APC. However, several studies were performed before the<lb/> heterogeneous nature of anti-phospholipid antibodies became<lb/></div>
