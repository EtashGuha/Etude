		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Semantic query optimization can dramatically speed up database query answering by <lb/>knowledge intensive reformulation. But the <lb/>problem of how to learn required semantic <lb/>rules has not previously been solved. This <lb/>paper describes an approach using an inductive learning algorithm to solve the problem. In our approach, learning is triggered <lb/>by user queries and then the system induces semantic rules from the information in <lb/>databases. The inductive learning algorithm <lb/>used in this approach can select an appropriate set of relevant attributes from a potentially huge number of attributes in real-world <lb/>databases. Experimental results demonstrate <lb/>that this approach can learn sufficient background knowledge to reformulate queries and <lb/>provide a 57 percent average performance improvement. <lb/></div>
