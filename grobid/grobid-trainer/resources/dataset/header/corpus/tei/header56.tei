		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The NASA Numerical Propulsion System Simulation <lb/>(NPSS) project is exploring the use of computer simulation <lb/>to facilitate the design of new jet engines. Several key issues <lb/>raised in this research are being examined in an NPSS-related research project: zooming, monitoring and control, <lb/>and support for heterogeneity. The design of a simulation <lb/>executive that addresses each of these issues is described. <lb/>In this work, the strategy of zooming, which allows codes <lb/>that model at different levels of fidelity to be integrated <lb/>within a single simulation, is applied to the fan component <lb/>of a turbofan propulsion system. A prototype monitoring <lb/>and control system has been designed for this simulation to <lb/>support experimentation with expert system techniques for <lb/>active control of the simulation. An interconnection system <lb/>provides a transparent means of connecting the heterogeneous systems that comprise the prototype. <lb/></div>
