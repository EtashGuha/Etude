	<div type="abstract">Wild-type strains of Campylobacter fetus are covered by a monomolecular array of surface layer proteins<lb/> (SLPs) critical for virulence. Each cell possesses eight SLP gene cassettes, tightly clustered in the genome, that<lb/> encode SLPs of 97 to 149 kDa. Variation of SLP expression occurs by a mechanism of nested DNA rearrange-<lb/>ment that involves the inversion of a 6.2-kb sapA promoter-containing element alone or together with one or more<lb/> flanking SLP gene cassettes. The presence of extensive regions of identity flanking the 5؅ and 3؅ ends of each<lb/> SLP gene cassette and of a Chi-like recognition sequence within the 5؅ region of identity suggests that rear-<lb/>rangement of SLP gene cassettes may occur by a generalized (RecA-dependent) homologous recombination<lb/> pathway. To explore this possibility, we cloned C. fetus recA and created mutant strains by marker rescue, in<lb/> which recA is disrupted in either S<lb/> ؉ or S<lb/> ؊ strains. These mutants then were assessed for their abilities to alter SLP<lb/> expression either in the presence or absence of a complementary shuttle plasmid harboring native recA. In<lb/> contrast to all previously reported programmed DNA inversion systems, inversion in C. fetus is recA dependent.<lb/></div>
