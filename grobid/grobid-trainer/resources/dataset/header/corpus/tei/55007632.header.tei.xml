	<div type="abstract">Elucidating kinetic information (rate constants) from temporally resolved<lb/> hyperspectral confocal fluorescence images offers some very important<lb/> opportunities for the interpretation of spatially resolved hyperspectral<lb/> confocal fluorescence images but also presents significant challenges, these<lb/> being (1) the massive amount of data contained in a series of time-resolved<lb/> spectral images (one time course of spectral data for each pixel) and (2)<lb/> unknown concentrations of the reactants and products at time ¼ 0, a<lb/> necessary precondition normally required by traditional kinetic fitting<lb/> approaches. This paper describes two methods for solving these problems:<lb/> direct nonlinear (DNL) estimation of all parameters and separable least<lb/> squares (SLS). The DNL method can be applied to reactions of any rate<lb/> law, while the SLS method is restricted to first-order reactions. In SLS, the<lb/> inherently linear and nonlinear parameters of first-order reactions are<lb/> solved in separate linear and nonlinear steps, respectively. The new<lb/> methods are demonstrated using simulated data sets and an experimental<lb/> data set involving photobleaching of several fluorophores. This work<lb/> demonstrates that both DNL and SLS hard-modeling methods applied to<lb/> the kinetic modeling of temporally resolved hyperspectral images can<lb/> outperform traditional soft-modeling and hard/soft-modeling methods<lb/> which use multivariate curve resolution–alternating least squares (MCR-<lb/>ALS) methods. In addition, the SLS method is much faster and is able to<lb/> analyze much larger data sets than the DNL method.<lb/></div>
