	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Ž .<lb/> Ž . Ž Ž ..<lb/> The iron VI derivative, potassium ferrate VI Fe VI has properties such as high stability, oxidizing power,<lb/> Ž .<lb/> Ž .<lb/> selectivity, and a non-toxic by-product Fe III , that make potassium ferrate VI an environmentally friendly oxidant<lb/> for natural waters. This paper presents a review of its properties and its role in environmental and industrial removal<lb/> Ž .<lb/> of contaminants. Fe VI is a powerful oxidizing agent throughout the entire pH range with a reduction potential<lb/> Ž .<lb/> varying from q2.2 V to q0.7 V in acidic and basic solutions, respectively. Fe VI ion reduces rapidly and<lb/> Ž .<lb/> Ž .<lb/> exothermally to Fe III and oxygen in strong acids, while the oxygen ligands of Fe VI exchange very slowly with<lb/> Ž .<lb/> water at pH 10. In dilute solutions, the lowest rate of reduction of Fe VI by water occurs between pH 9.4 and 9.7.<lb/> Ž .<lb/> Ž .<lb/> Ž .<lb/> Fe VI is also a selective oxidant for a large number of organic compounds with Fe III as a by-product. Fe VI<lb/> Ž .<lb/> Ž .<lb/> therefore has a role in cleaner &apos;greener&apos; technology for organic synthesis. Other applications of Fe VI include<lb/> Ž .<lb/> production of ferrate V by pulse radiolysis, &apos;super-iron&apos; batteries, and wastewater treatment processes. Many of the<lb/> Ž .<lb/> contaminants in wastewater can be removed by Fe VI in seconds to minutes with formation of non-hazardous<lb/> Ž .<lb/> products. Fe VI is also a disinfectant, antifoulant, and coagulant, and therefore a promising multi-purpose<lb/> wastewater treatment chemical. ᮊ</div>
