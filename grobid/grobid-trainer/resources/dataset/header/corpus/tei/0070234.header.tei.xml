	<div type="abstract">A b s t r a c t The Internet represents a different type of technology for publishers of<lb/> scientific, technical, and medical journals. It is not a technology that sustains current markets and<lb/> creates new efficiencies but is, rather, a disruptive technology that could radically alter market<lb/> forces, profit expectations, and business models. This paper is a translation and amplification of<lb/> the research done in this area, applied to a large-circulation new science journal, Pediatrics. The<lb/> findings suggest that the journal of the future will be electronic, have a less volatile cost<lb/> structure, be supported more by services than by content, be less able to rely on subscription<lb/> revenues, and abandon certain elements of current value networks. It also provides a possible<lb/> framework for other publishers to use to evaluate their own journals relative to this disruptive<lb/> technology.<lb/></div>
