	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Background. Research biopsies are crucial for exploring<lb/> the impact of novel agents on putative targets. The cur-<lb/>rent study assesses the safety and success rate associated<lb/> with performing such biopsies.<lb/> Methods. We reviewed the medical records of 155 con-<lb/>secutive patients who had one or more research biopsies as<lb/> part of a phase I trial from September 2004 to October 2009.<lb/> Results. Of 281 research biopsies performed, 118 were<lb/> paired before and after treatment biopsies (total ‫؍‬ 236 bi-<lb/>opsies). The most common sites of biopsy were superficial<lb/> lymph node (19.9%), followed by liver (16.4%), and then<lb/> soft tissue (15.7%). Ultrasound-guided biopsies were the<lb/> most frequent type (53.7%). Among 142 patients who con-<lb/>sented for mandatory biopsy, 86.6% had the biopsy per-<lb/>formed, compared with 4.4% of 911 patients offered a<lb/> biopsy on an optional basis (p &lt; .0001). Biopsy was ob-<lb/>tained most frequently on industry-sponsored trials; lack<lb/> of funding on nonindustry trials was the most common<lb/> reason that biopsies were not obtained. Of 281 single biop-<lb/>sies, only 4 (1.4%) had complications: pneumothorax re-<lb/>quiring chest tube placement (n ‫؍‬ 2), infection requiring<lb/> admission (n ‫؍‬ 1), and arrhythmia with hypotension (n ‫؍‬<lb/> 1). All but one biopsy was successful in obtaining tissue.<lb/> No deaths were attributable to biopsy.<lb/> Conclusions. Our experience demonstrates that re-<lb/>search biopsies in early phase clinical trials are safe<lb/> (1.4% risk of serious complications), and a higher per-<lb/>centage of patients underwent mandatory biopsies<lb/> (86.6%) compared with that of the patients with op-<lb/>tional biopsies (4.4%).</div>
