		<div type="abstract">Abstract| In this paper, we use a genetic algorithm to evolve a set of classification rules with <lb/>real-valued attributes. We show how real-valued <lb/>attribute ranges can be encoded with real-valued <lb/>genes and present a new uniform method for representing don&apos;t cares in the rules. We view supervised classification as an optimization problem, <lb/>and evolve rule sets that maximize the number of <lb/>correct classifications of input instances. We use a <lb/>variant of the Pitt approach to genetic-based machine learning system with a novel conflict resolution mechanism between competing rules within <lb/>the same rule set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach <lb/>on a benchmark wine classifier system. <lb/></div>
