	<div type="abstract">Title: Overall survival and progression free survival results for a randomized phase 2 trial of ipilimumab (IPI) and paclitaxel/carboplatin (P/C) in<lb/> first-line Stage IIIb/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)<lb/> Abstract Background: IPI is a fully human monoclonal antibody that potentiates immune response by inhibiting CTLA-4. CA184-041 is a double-blind,<lb/> randomized phase 2 study of IPI combination with P/C in chemotherapy naïve recurrent/metastatic lung cancer.<lb/> Methods: 204 pts were randomized 1:1:1 to receive: IPI + concurrent schedule (CON) IV P/C (N=70), IPI + phased schedule (PHA) P/C (N=68),<lb/> or P/C alone (PBO) (N=66). IPI was administered at 10 mg/kg every 3weeks (wks) starting with cycle (c) 1 x 4 (CON) or starting with c 3 x 4<lb/> (PHA) then every 3 months. P/C was given as 175 mg/m<lb/> 2 and AUC=6 every 3wks x 6. Efficacy was assessed by immune-related response<lb/> criteria (irRC) and mWHO. The primary endpoint compared immune-related PFS (irPFS) between CON vs PBO and PHA vs PBO. One-sided<lb/> log-rank test (α=0.10) used to calculate statistical significance.<lb/> Results: Baseline characteristics were generally balanced. Ipilimumab in combination with P/C extended median irPFS for both the CON (5.52<lb/> mo [95% CI: 4.17, 6.74], p=0.094, HR=0.775 [95% CI: 0.53, 1.13] and PHA regimens (5.68 mo [95% CI: 4.76, 7.79], p=0.026, HR=0.686 [95%<lb/> CI: 0.47, 1.01]) compared to P/C alone (4.63 mo [95% CI: 4.14, 5.52]). IPI plus P/C extended mWHO PFS in the PHA arm only compared to P/C<lb/> alone (5.13 mo [95% CI: 4.17, 5.72], p=0.024, HR=0.691 [95% CI: 0.48, 1.00] vs. 4.21 mo [95% CI: 2.76, 5.32]). Interim median OS trended in<lb/> favor of the IPI arm for the PHA regimen (11.56 mo [95% CI: 9.26, 14.39], p=0.104, HR=0.748 [95% CI: 0.48, 1.18]) compared to P/C alone<lb/> (9.99 mo [95% CI: 6.97, 13.63]. IPI in combination with P/C did not appear to significantly extend interim median OS for the CON regimen<lb/> (11.01 mo [95% CI: 8.38, 12.75], p=0.429, HR=0.962 [95% CI: 0.63, 1.48]) compared to P/C alone 11.56 mo (95% CI: 9.26, 14.39). Final OS<lb/> results will be presented. IPI + P/C was generally well tolerated. Total gr 3/4 irAEs (pruritis, rash, alopecia, diarrhea, colitis) were 20% and 15%<lb/> for CON and PHA regimens, respectively; and were reversible in most cases. Gr 5 toxic epidermal necrolysis was seen in 1 pt for CON.<lb/> Conclusion: Ipilimumab in combination with P/C met its primary endpoint by demonstrating superiority in irPFS compared with P/C alone with<lb/> consistent findings across other efficacy endpoints. The PHA regimen appeared to demonstrate better efficacy than the CON regimen.<lb/> Ipilimumab did not increase P/C related toxicity. These results support further study of ipilimumab in NSCLC.<lb/></div>
