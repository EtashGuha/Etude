			<div type="abstract">Abstract— As the size of data storing arrays of disks grows,<lb/>
				it becomes vital to protect data against double disk failures. An<lb/> economic way
				of providing such protection consists of adding<lb/> two disks to the array. The
				increased storage capacity of the<lb/> array is used to store the information
				necessary for the recovery<lb/> of all data in the case any two disks fail (RAID-6).
				A popular<lb/> method of generating recovery information from data utilizes<lb/>
				linear operations in the Galois field GF (2 8 ). Mathematically, this<lb/> solution
				is equivalent to using the Reed-Solomon (RS) code with<lb/> two parity words. Its
				principle advantage is based on simplicity<lb/> of the basic operations in a field
				extension of the primary field<lb/> GF (2): addition is just bitwise XOR, while
				multiplication can<lb/> be constructed using shifts, AN D's and additions.<lb/> The
				RS code with two parity words is an example of a<lb/> linear block code capable of
				correcting up to two errors in<lb/> known positions per block. In the paper we
				construct alternative<lb/> examples of linear block codes which can be used in
				RAID-<lb/> 6. Our construction is based on a matrix representation of the<lb/> roots
				of unity. We analyze an assembly implementation of the<lb/> corresponding RAID-6 on
				a general purpose processor and find<lb/> that in certain situations it outperforms
				the RS-based RAID-6<lb/> scheme in terms of write and recovery speed and also in
				terms<lb/> of the memory usage.<lb/>
