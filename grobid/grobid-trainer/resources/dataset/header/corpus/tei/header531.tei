		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Weak connectivity, in the form of intermittent, low-bandwidth, or expensive networks is a fact of life in mobile computing. <lb/>In this paper, we describe how the Coda File System has evolved to exploit such networks. The underlying theme of this <lb/>evolution has been the systematic introduction of adaptivity to eliminate hidden assumptions about strong connectivity. <lb/>Many aspects of the system, including communication, cache validation, update propagation and cache miss handling have <lb/>been modified. As a result, Coda is able to provide good performance even when network bandwidth varies over four orders <lb/>of magnitude from modem speeds to LAN speeds. <lb/></div>
