		<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT <lb/>Simplicial depth is a way to measure how deep a point is among a set of points. Efficient <lb/>algorithms to compute it are important to the usefulness of its applications, such as in <lb/>multivariate analysis in statistics. A straightforward method takes O(n d+1 ) time when the <lb/>points are in d-dimensional space. We discuss an algorithm that takes O(n 2 ) time when the <lb/>points are in three-dimensional space, and we generalize it to four-dimensional space with <lb/>a time complexity of O(n 4 ). For spaces higher than four-dimensional, there are no known <lb/>algorithms faster than the straightforward method. <lb/></div>
