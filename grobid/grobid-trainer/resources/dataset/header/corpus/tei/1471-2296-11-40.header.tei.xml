	<div type="abstract">Abstract Background: Sexual problems are common among people with coronary heart disease and can adversely affect<lb/> patients' quality of life. GPs are ideally placed to deal with these problems. Research suggests that GPs are reluctant to<lb/> address sexual problems but little is known about what currently takes place in practice. The aim of this study was to<lb/> examine GPs' self-reported behaviour and attitudes to discussing sexual problems with people with coronary heart<lb/> disease.<lb/> Method: Design: A cross-sectional survey which administered 230 postal questionnaires to a nationally representative,<lb/> stratified random sample of GPs in the Republic of Ireland. GPs were asked about current practice, knowledge,<lb/> awareness and confidence in dealing with sexual problems, barriers to addressing sexual problems, and about<lb/> improving services in this area.</div>
