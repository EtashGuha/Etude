		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The graph topo-visual formalism has been shown to <lb/>be well-suited to the task of visualizing complex relations on a set of elements. Unfortunately, most visual <lb/>formalisms do not scale very well. This observation is <lb/>particularly true of graphs, which even when hand-drawn <lb/>by an artist, are seldom meaningful when the number of <lb/>nodes or links exceeds a very modest threshold typically only a few hundred elements. This severe limitation <lb/>has prompted many researchers to seek alternative visualization techniques that may eliminate, or, at the very <lb/>least, raise this threshold. <lb/>In this paper we analyze these recent efforts, describe <lb/>an abstract space of presentation emphasis techniques, <lb/>and locate the current approaches within this space. The <lb/>contributions of this paper are several: (1) a significant <lb/>portion of recent work is collected and reviewed; (2) a <lb/>common set of criteria and a taxonomy of graph views <lb/>are proposed; these, (3) permit a more direct comparison <lb/>of previous work; which helps to, (4) identify common <lb/>shortcomings and limitations; which in turn, (5) suggest <lb/>future directions. <lb/></div>
