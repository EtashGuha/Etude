		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper describes a media-independent, compositional, plan-based approach to representing attributive descriptions for use in integrated text and graphics generation. An attributive <lb/>description&apos;s main function is to convey information directly contributing to the communicative <lb/>goals of a discourse, whereas a referential description&apos;s only function is to enable the audience <lb/>to identify a particular referent. This approach has been implemented as part of an architecture <lb/>for generating integrated text and information graphics. Uses of referential and attributive descriptions are represented as two distinct types of communicative acts in a media-independent <lb/>plan. It is particularly important to distinguish the two types of acts, since they have different <lb/>consequences for dialogue and text generation, and for graphic design. <lb/></div>
