		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Experiments have shown[1],[2] that ion acoustic solitons tunnel through the space charge sheath <lb/>in front of a grid without time delay. They are absorbed resonantly when the spatial width of the <lb/>wave is close to the characteristic gradient scale length of the sheath. The reflection and transmission <lb/>coefficients found in these experiments have compared well with theory in the long wavelength limit[3]. <lb/>However, to achieve this comparison, two parameters were added that were not in the original theory. <lb/>These parameters allow for the absorption of wave energy by the space charge sheath. The goal of our <lb/>numerical simulations, designed to reproduce the experimental results, is to uncover the mechanism of <lb/>this energy loss and large speed of propagation through the sheath. <lb/></div>
