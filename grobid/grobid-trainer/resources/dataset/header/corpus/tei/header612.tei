		<div type="abstract">We report on work done to develop a benchmark problem for genetic programming, both <lb/>as a difficult problem to test GP abilities and as a platform for tuning GP parameters. <lb/>This benchmark, the royal tree, is a function that accounts for tree shape as part of its <lb/>evaluation function, thus it controls for a parameter not often found in the GP literature. <lb/>It also is a progressive function, allowing the user to set the difficulty of the problem <lb/>attempted. We not only describe the function, but also report on results of using island <lb/>parallelism for solving GP problems. The results obtained are somewhat surprising, as it <lb/>appears that a single large population outperforms a group of smaller populations under <lb/>all the conditions tested. <lb/></div>
