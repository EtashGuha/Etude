		<div type="abstract">Generalized Einstein - Aether vector field models have been shown to provide, in the weak field <lb/>regime, modifications to gravity which can be reconciled with the successfull MOND proposal. Very <lb/>little is known, however, on the function F(K) defining the vector field Lagrangian so that an <lb/>analysis of the viability of such theories at the cosmological scales has never been performed. As <lb/>a first step along this route, we rely on the relation between F(K) and the MOND interpolating <lb/>function ï¿½(a/a0) to assign the vector field Lagrangian thus obtaining what we refer to as MONDian <lb/>vector models. Since they are able by construction to recover the MOND successes on galaxy scales, <lb/>we investigate whether they can also drive the observed accelerated expansion by fitting the models <lb/>to the Type Ia Supernovae data. Should be this the case, we have a unified framework where both <lb/>dark energy and dark matter can be seen as different manifestations of a single vector field. It <lb/>turns out that both MONDian vector models are able to well fit the low redshift data on Type Ia <lb/>Supernovae, while some tension could be present in the high z regime. <lb/></div>
