		<div type="abstract">Abstract. Constraints of a mathematical program are distributed among parallel processors together with an appropriately constructed augmented Lagrangian for each processor, which contains <lb/>Lagrangian information on the constraints handled by the other processors. Lagrange multiplier information is then exchanged between processors. Convergence is established under suitable conditions <lb/>for strongly convex quadratic programs and for general convex programs. <lb/></div>
