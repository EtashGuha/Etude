	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Secondary injury following traumatic spinal cord injury is induced by the activation of a number of cellular and molecular changes.<lb/> RhoA, a small GTPase, regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, gene expression, cell proliferation, and has been implicated in<lb/> the regenerative process. This study was undertaken to investigate the involvement of the RhoA signaling pathway in the secondary injury<lb/> that follows traumatic spinal cord injury in rats. RhoA mRNA and protein expressions were enhanced significantly in the injured spinal<lb/> cord 1 week after surgery (P,0.05, ANOVA). C3 exozyme (RhoA inhibitor), Y-27632 (selective Rho kinase inhibitor), and Fasudil<lb/> (non-selective protein kinase inhibitor) were administered after spinal cord injury, and the subjects were evaluated for 5 weeks as per BBB<lb/> locomotor score. Poor rat response interrupted the C3 experiment. Y-27632 slightly, but significantly (P,0.05, ANOVA), delayed the<lb/> recovery. Fasudil significantly improved the BBB score (P,0.05, ANOVA). In conclusion, spinal cord injury activates the RhoA / Rho-<lb/>kinase a, b associated pathway. However, their role in secondary injury or in the improvement of functional recovery remains unclear.<lb/> Fasudil might exert a cytoprotective effect by mechanisms other than inhibiting Rho-kinase a, b.<lb/></div>
