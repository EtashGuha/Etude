		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In this paper we describe a formal framework for the problem of mining association rules. The theoretical foundation is based on the field of formal concept analysis. A concept is composed of closed subsets of attributes (itemsets) <lb/>and objects (transactions). We show that all frequent itemsets are uniquely determined by the frequent concepts. We <lb/>further show how this lattice-theoretic framework can be used to find a small rule generating set, from which one can <lb/>infer all other association rules. <lb/></div>
