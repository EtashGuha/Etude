	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Introduction: In recent years the demand for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D<lb/> (25OHD) analysis has increased significantly. In addition to the role vitamin<lb/> D plays in bone metabolism, several clinical studies now link vitamin D<lb/> deficiency with increased risk for some cancers, multiple sclerosis and heart<lb/> disease. 25OHD concentration is accepted as the clinical indicator for<lb/> determining vitamin D status and is also important for monitoring<lb/> supplementation therapy, which is available in two forms, vitamin D2 and<lb/> vitamin D3. Many clinical laboratories have now adopted LC/MS/MS based<lb/> methods for measuring 25OHD to enable the simultaneous and reliable<lb/> measurement of 25OHD2 and 25OHD3. Some immunoassays may under<lb/> report the total 25OHD level for patients on Vitamin D2 supplementation<lb/> due to the cross-reactivity of the antibody for 25OHD2 being less than<lb/> 100%. The analysis of 25OHD by LC/MS/MS requires a number of sample<lb/> pre-treatment steps to release 25OHD from Vitamin D binding protein and<lb/> to minimise matrix effects. This method describes a semi-automated<lb/> sample pre-treatment protocol in combination with UPLC/MS/MS for the<lb/> analysis of 25OHD.<lb/> Methodology: For the initial study, twenty samples were analysed using<lb/> an established manual liquid/liquid solvent extraction LC/MS/MS method at<lb/> UHSM. All serum samples were anonymised and stored at -20°C.<lb/> Calibrators were prepared in horse serum (Sigma) over the concentration<lb/> range 2.5-100ng/mL and QC samples were prepared independently.<lb/> Commercially available calibrator and QC material from Chromsystems<lb/> were also analysed. Primary serum samples and calibrators were placed on<lb/> a robotic liquid-handling system and identified by bar code and tracked<lb/> throughout the extraction procedure. Internal standard was added to the<lb/> dispensed samples prior to protein precipitation. Following centrifugation<lb/> (off-line), the supernatant was transferred to a conditioned Oasis<lb/> ®<lb/> µElution SPE plate and washed. The retained analytes were eluted by the liquid-<lb/>handling system and the eluant was chromatographed using a Waters<lb/> ACQUITY UPLC™ with an ACQUITY BEH Phenyl column (2.1x50mm) with a<lb/> water/methanol/ammonium acetate gradient. A Waters TQD mass<lb/> spectrometer was used to quantify 25OHD2 or 25OHD3, monitoring two<lb/> transitions for each analyte.<lb/> Results: The assay was linear over the range 2.5-100ng/mL with a<lb/> coefficient of determination (r<lb/> 2<lb/> ) of &gt; 0.997. The inter-and intra-assay<lb/> imprecision at three levels was less than 10%CV (n=5, over 5 days). The<lb/> calculated 25OHD concentrations of the twenty patient samples were in<lb/> good agreement with the LC/MS/MS measurements from UHSM, using<lb/> Passing-Bablok analysis Waters=1.01(UHSM)-1.45. Ion suppression studies<lb/> were conducted and demonstrated minimal ion suppression for 25OHD3.<lb/> Conclusion: A routine semi-automated solid phase extraction UPLC/MS/MS<lb/> method for the analysis of 25OHD2 or 25OHD3 in serum has been<lb/> developed. The assay has acceptable performance characteristics (linearity,<lb/> sensitivity, precision and accuracy) and allows the analysis of at least 192<lb/> samples per working day. The semi-automated procedure significantly<lb/> reduces the manual operation steps, eliminates solvent evaporation,<lb/> reconstitution and operator variability to ensure more consistent and<lb/> reproducible results.<lb/></div>
