	<div type="abstract">Abstract. In real life, one requires signatures to be from people who ful-<lb/>fill certain criteria, implying that they should possess specific attributes.<lb/> For example, Alice might want a signature from an employee in Bobs<lb/> company who is a member in the IT staff, a senior manager within the<lb/> biometrics team or at least a junior manager in the cryptography team.<lb/> In such a case an Attribute Based Group Signature scheme (ABGS)<lb/> could be applied. Group signature schemes are those where each mem-<lb/>ber of a group can sign on behalf of the others. An ABGS scheme is a<lb/> type of group signature scheme, where the signing member has to have<lb/> certain attributes. In [12], the authors introduced the first ABGS but it<lb/> lacked the ability to revoke. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme<lb/> that will enable us to remove a member from a group or remove some of<lb/> his attributes, when needed.<lb/></div>
