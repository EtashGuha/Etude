	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Flash memory has become the most important storage<lb/> media in mobile devices, and is beginning to replace<lb/> hard disks in desktop systems. However, its relatively<lb/> poor random write performance may cause problems in<lb/> the desktop environment, which has much more compli-<lb/>cated requirements than mobile devices. While a RAM<lb/> buffer has been quite successful in hard disks to mask the<lb/> low efficiency of random writes, managing such a buffer<lb/> to fully exploit the characteristics of flash storage has<lb/> still not been resolved. In this paper, we propose a new<lb/> write buffer management scheme called Block Padding<lb/> Least Recently Used, which significantly improves the<lb/> random write performance of flash storage. We evalu-<lb/>ate the scheme using trace-driven simulations and exper-<lb/>iments with a prototype implementation. It shows about<lb/> 44% enhanced performance for the workload of MS Of-<lb/>fice 2003 installation.<lb/></div>
