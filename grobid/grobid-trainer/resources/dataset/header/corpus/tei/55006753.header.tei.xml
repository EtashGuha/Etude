	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Bag-of-features (BoF) deriving from local keypoints has re-<lb/>cently appeared promising for object and scene classifica-<lb/>tion. Whether BoF can naturally survive the challenges<lb/> such as reliability and scalability of visual classification, nev-<lb/>ertheless, remains uncertain due to various implementation<lb/> choices. In this paper, we evaluate various factors which<lb/> govern the performance of BoF. The factors include the<lb/> choices of detector, kernel, vocabulary size and weighting<lb/> scheme. We offer some practical insights in how to opti-<lb/>mize the performance by choosing good keypoint detector<lb/> and kernel. For the weighting scheme, we propose a novel<lb/> soft-weighting method to assess the significance of a visual<lb/> word to an image. We experimentally show that the pro-<lb/>posed soft-weighting scheme can consistently offer better<lb/> performance than other popular weighting methods. On<lb/> both PASCAL-2005 and TRECVID-2006 datasets, our BoF<lb/> setting generates competitive performance compared to the<lb/> state-of-the-art techniques. We also show that the BoF is<lb/> highly complementary to global features. By incorporating<lb/> the BoF with color and texture features, an improvement of<lb/> 50% is reported on TRECVID-2006 dataset.<lb/></div>
