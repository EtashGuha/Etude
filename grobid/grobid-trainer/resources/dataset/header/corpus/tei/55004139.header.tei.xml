	<titlePart>VI. THE EFFECT OF ACIDITY ON TYPE AND REVERSIBILITY OF EMULSIONS<lb/> </titlePart>
	</docTitle>
	
	<div type="introduction">Introductory The author&apos;s observations on the effect of acidity on the behavior of emul-<lb/>sions are limited to emulsions of olive oil.<lb/> The fact that sodium hydroxide causes reversal of certain emulsions in one<lb/> direction while sodium chloride does not, suggests, as do numerous other be-<lb/>havior phenomena, that acidity might be a factor in phase reversal. Accord-<lb/>ingly, H-ion concentration determinations were made of ten of the emulsifiers<lb/> used in these studied on olive oil emulsions, both before and after the addition<lb/> of electrolytes to the emulsions.<lb/> Experimental The colorimetric method of measuring H-ion concentration was employed,<lb/> except in those few instances where the value was over IO. Since this method<lb/> is not adapted to measuring acidity of such turbid systems as oil emulsions<lb/> and could not possibly be employed to determine the pH of water-in-oil<lb/> emulsions, the pH values of the aqueous phase were measured separately, i.e.,<lb/> apart from the emulsions. The actual acidity values of the emulsifiers when in<lb/> the emulsions undoubtedly differ from that of the emulsifiers alone, owing to<lb/> the acidity of the olive oil, but for comparative purposes the values obtained<lb/> are suitable.<lb/> The pH values and concentrations of the ten emulsifiers are given in Table<lb/> V. There is also given the type of emulsion which each emulsifier produces</div>
