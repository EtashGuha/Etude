	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> The ionospheric correction procedure of the current<lb/> MSAS, the Japanese version of SBAS/WAAS, is built on<lb/> the algorithm named the &apos;planar fit.&apos; It estimates the<lb/> ionospheric propagation delays at IGPs using a first order<lb/> estimator, and the associated confidence bound broadcast<lb/> for computation of protection levels, based on the formal<lb/> variance of the estimate. In such an estimation process,<lb/> there are threats regarding mismodeling of the ionosphere<lb/> and undersampling so it is necessary to inflate the<lb/> confidence bound (GIVE values) to ensure that the<lb/> integrity requirement is met. This inflation leads to<lb/> relatively large GIVE values and thus lowers availability<lb/> of the system for flight modes with vertical guidance.<lb/> In Japan, we have a continuous GPS observation network,<lb/> known as the GEONET, operated by the Geographical<lb/> Survey Institute of Japan. GEONET has over one<lb/> thousand realtime GPS stations distributed inside Japan<lb/> with an average separation of 20-30 km. This paper<lb/> investigates integrating GEONET with MSAS for<lb/> generation of ionospheric corrections.<lb/> The authors have developed a new ionospheric correction<lb/> algorithm optimizing ionospheric delay residuals based on<lb/> the observations obtained by GEONET. The current<lb/> planar fit algorithm is not optimal for such a situation as<lb/> the algorithm must be capable of handling a very large<lb/> number of IPP observations. Our analysis is currently<lb/> based on the GPS observation dataset obtained at all<lb/> available GEONET sites with 30-second sampling. It<lb/> allows us to conduct analyses not only for the recent<lb/> conditions when the ionosphere may be quiet but also for<lb/> historical storm events because GEONET maintains its<lb/> database for a period of more than ten years.<lb/> The ionospheric corrections generated from GEONET<lb/> improved correction performance, and more importantly,<lb/> could reduce the GIVE values which impact the<lb/> uncertainty of ionospheric corrections and are used for<lb/> computation of protection levels. Due to the high density<lb/> of monitor stations and IPP observations, these<lb/> corrections could reduce the inflation factor and the<lb/> spatial threat term, thus minimizing GIVE values.<lb/> According to our simulation using prototype SBAS<lb/> software, the proposed algorithm possibly enables APV-II<lb/> </div>
