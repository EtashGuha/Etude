		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Genetic Programming is applied to the task of <lb/>evolving general iterative sorting algorithms. A <lb/>connection between size and generality was discovered. Adding inverse size to the fitness measure along with correctness not only decreases <lb/>the size of the resulting evolved algorithms, but <lb/>also dramatically increases their generality and <lb/>thus the effectiveness of the evolution process. In <lb/>addition, a variety of differing problem formulations are investigated and the relative probability <lb/>of success for each is reported. An example of an <lb/>evolved sort from each problem formulation is <lb/>presented, and an initial attempt is made to <lb/>understand the variations in difficulty resulting <lb/>from these differing problem formulations. <lb/></div>
