			<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> This article proposes a cooperative relaying strategy
				to efficiently utilize the relaying resources of Internet service providers<lb/>
				(ISPs), speedup distribution and save server bandwidth costs. ISPs cooperatively
				relay for each other, and peers assist in<lb/> distributing and fetching the content
				as near as possible. Base on the fluid model, a constrained model is derived to get
				optimized<lb/> global distribution performance in the channel-based system with
				limited relaying resources. The multi-objectives of the model<lb/> are minimizing
				the average distribution time and the distribution time of the slowest channel.
				Genetic algorithm (GA) is designed<lb/> to solve the optimization problem. The
				relaying strategy based on GA can be run periodically to update the allocation
				policy of<lb/> ISPs. The distribution performance of the relaying strategy is
				analyzed in the experiments and results show that GA can provide<lb/> proper
				solutions for various network topologies.<lb/></div>
