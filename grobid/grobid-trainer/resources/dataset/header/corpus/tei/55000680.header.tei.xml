	<div type="introduction">If you found this article helpful, you&apos;ll also want to read the following:<lb/> How to use video to set up viral list-building outposts<lb/> How to add an opt-in form inside your video and boost signups to your newsletter<lb/> I wanted to share this quick tip with you about sharing YouTube videos. It has been so useful for me since having<lb/> recently learned about it myself.<lb/> The tip is about a simple piece of information you can append to the URL (web address) of a YouTube video that<lb/> allows you to link someone directly to a specific point (timecode) in that video.<lb/> For example, had I known about this in a previous post I wrote about Google Wave&apos;s on-the-fly translation feature<lb/> called Rosie, then I could&apos;ve done away with instructions stating, &quot;...If you want to see the demo without<lb/> sitting through the entire 80 minutes of video, then scrub forward to about time code 1:13:00...&quot; (Yep,<lb/> the entire video was about an hour and twenty minutes long.)<lb/> Instead, I could&apos;ve simply said, &quot;...to see the specific part of the video with the Rosie demo, click here.&quot;<lb/> The reason that works, is because I learned that we could all simply have appended the following information to the<lb/> end of the YouTube video&apos;s URL:<lb/> &quot;#t=xhxmxs&quot;<lb/> (Where x is a number representing the hours, minutes and seconds, respectively.)<lb/> In other words, to get you to the point that is 1-hour, 13-minutes and 5-seconds into the YouTube video that is<lb/> defined by this link:<lb/>

	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_UyVmITiYQ<lb/> (copied directly from the YouTube video page), then all you&apos;d have to do is add #t=1h13m5s to the end of the URL.<lb/> What you&apos;d want to share with folks to whom you forward the video, then, would be:<lb/>
