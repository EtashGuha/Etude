				a b s t r a c t<lb/> The major economic driving force for recycling of waste printed circuit boards (PCBs)<lb/>
				is the value of the metallic fractions (MFs) of PCBs. The non-metallic fractions (NMFs),<lb/>
				which take up almost 70 wt% of waste PCBs, were treated by combustion or land filling in<lb/>
				the past. However, combustion of the NMFs will cause the formation of highly toxic<lb/>
				polybrominated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs) while land filling of the NMFs<lb/>
				will lead to secondary pollution caused by heavy metals and brominated flame retardants<lb/>
				(BFRs) leaching to the groundwater. Therefore, recycling of the NMFs from waste PCBs is<lb/>
				drawing more and more attention from the public and the governments. Currently, how to<lb/>
				recycle the NMFs environmental soundly has become a significant topic in recycling of<lb/>
				waste PCBs. In order to fulfill the better resource utilization of the NMFs, the<lb/>
				compositions and characteristics of the NMFs, methods and outcomes of recycling the NMFs<lb/>
				from waste PCBs and analysis and treatment for the hazardous substances contained in the<lb/>
				NMFs were reviewed in this paper. Thermosetting resin matrix composites, thermoplastic<lb/>
				matrix composites, concrete and viscoelastic materials are main applications for physi-<lb/>
				cal recycling of the NMFs. Chemical recycling methods consisting of pyrolysis,<lb/>
				gasification, supercritical fluids depolymerization and hydrogenolytic degradation can<lb/>
				be used to convert the NMFs to chemical feedstocks and fuels. The toxicity<lb/>
				characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and synthetic precipitation leaching procedure<lb/>
				(SPLP) can be used to determine the toxicity characteristic (TC) of the NMFs and to<lb/>
				evaluate the environmental safety of products made from the recycled NMFs. It is<lb/>
				believed that physi- cal recycling of the NMFs has been a promising recycling method.<lb/>
				Much more work should be done to develop comprehensive and industrialized usage of the<lb/>
				NMFs recycled by physical methods. Chemical recycling methods have the advantages in<lb/>
				eliminating hazardous substances in the NMFs. The trend in chemical recycling of the<lb/>
				NMFs is to make the best of advantages over physical recycling of the NMFs to compensate<lb/>
				its higher cost. Removing and treating the hazardous substances in the NMFs is an<lb/>
				ultimate method to eliminate the pollution.<lb/>
