		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper shows that members of the fourier transform family are the only linear <lb/>transforms that have a convolution theorem, that is, that can replace O(N 2 ) operations <lb/>of a convolution in a time domain by O(N) operations in a transform domain. Generally, <lb/>there is an additional cost to compute the transform itself. Our observation is motivated by <lb/>recent activity in wavelet and subband decompositions and related spectral analyses, which <lb/>are attractive alternatives for signal compression applications. A natural question when <lb/>using such techniques is to determine if convolutions of N -point signals can be calculated <lb/>with fewer operations in a compressed transform domain than in an uncompressed time <lb/>domain. The answer is negative for a broad set of assumptions. This paper indicates what <lb/>assumptions must be relaxed in seeking a linear transform that has a convolution theorem <lb/>comparable to the convolution theorem for fourier transforms. <lb/></div>
