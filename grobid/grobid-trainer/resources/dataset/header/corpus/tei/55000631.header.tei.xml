	<div type="abstract"> ABSTRACT<lb/> A round-trip, time-of-flight, high-precision, ranging radio<lb/> operating in the 915 MHz ISM band is presented. A<lb/> custom digital baseband processor is implemented on a<lb/> Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA and interfaced with COTS RF<lb/> hardware. Processing gain enabled by direct-sequence<lb/> spread-spectrum (DSSS) signaling directly improves the<lb/> ranging accuracy. The system is designed with free-<lb/>running baseband clocks that do not require fine<lb/> synchronization.<lb/> Prototype brassboard system<lb/> measurement accuracies of 7 cm (1-Ïƒ) have been obtained<lb/> during testing in an open field.<lb/>
