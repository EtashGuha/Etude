	<titlePart>What The Welding Inspector Should Know About Preheating And Postweld Heat<lb/> Treatment<lb/></titlePart>

	<div type="introduction">When welding some base materials and for some service conditions, preheating and/or postweld heat treatment<lb/> may be a requirement. These types of thermal treatments are generally required in order to ensure suitable weld<lb/> integrity and will typically prevent or remove undesirable characteristics in the completed weld. Any form of<lb/> heat treatment is costly since it demands extra equipment, extra time, and extra handling. For these reasons, heat<lb/> treatment should only be undertaken after careful consideration of the advantages it may offer. In certain cases<lb/> heat treatment will be mandatory, as with heavy sections of low alloy steels, whereas in other cases, it will be a<lb/> justifiable precaution against early failure in service.<lb/> There are a number of reasons for the incorporation of these thermal treatments within the welding procedure,<lb/> and we will consider some of the most common.<lb/> Preheating<lb/> Preheat, as defined within the AWS Standard Welding Terms and Definition, is &quot;the heat applied to the base<lb/> metal or substrate to attain and maintain preheat temperature&quot;. The preheat temperature is defined by the same<lb/> document as &quot;the temperature of the base metal in the volume surrounding the point of welding immediately<lb/> before welding is started. In a multipass weld, it is also the temperature immediately before the second and<lb/> subsequent passes are started&quot; (Interpass Temperature).<lb/> Preheating may be performed by the use of gas burners, oxy-gas flames, electric blankets, induction heating, or<lb/> by heating in a furnace. For good results, it is essential for the heating to be uniform around the joint area.<lb/> Intense, non-uniform heating is of little use in retarding cooling and may be detrimental in causing higher<lb/> residual stresses, distortion, or undesirable metallurgical changes in the base material. When preheating is<lb/> specified, the entire weld joint should be heated evenly through the material thickness to the desired minimum<lb/> temperature. To obtain a uniform temperature through the material thickness, it is desirable to apply the heating<lb/> sources to one side of the material surface and to measure the material temperature on the opposite side.<lb/> Whenever the heating and temperature measurement must be conducted from the same surface, the inspector<lb/> must assure that more than just the surface of the material has been heated. It is important to ensure that the<lb/> entire material thickness has been heated to a uniform temperature. In addition to establishing a preheat<lb/> temperature, an interpass temperature limitation may need to be considered for some applications. This<lb/> information should be shown in the welding procedure specification. When an interpass temperature is<lb/> specified, the weld area must be inspected prior to depositing the next weld bead. Welding may not continue if<lb/> the measured temperature exceeds the maximum interpass conditions specified in the welding procedure. The<lb/> weldment must be permitted to cool down to the specified upper limit of the interpass temperature before<lb/> continuing with the weld.</div>
