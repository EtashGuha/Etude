		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Design-to-time is an approach to problem-solving in resource-constrained domains where: <lb/>multiple solution methods are available for tasks, those solution methods make tradeoffs in <lb/>solution quality versus time, and satisficing solutions are acceptable. Design-to-time involves <lb/>designing a solution to a problem that uses all available resources to maximize the solution <lb/>quality within the available time. This paper defines the design-to-time approach in detail, <lb/>contrasting it to the anytime algorithm approach, and presents a heuristic algorithm for design-to-time real-time scheduling. <lb/>Our blackboard architecture that implements the design-to-time approach is discussed and <lb/>an example problem and solution from the Distributed Vehicle Monitoring Testbed (DVMT) is <lb/>described in detail. Experimental results, generated using a simulation, show the effects of <lb/>various parameters on scheduler performance. Finally we discuss future research goals and <lb/>plans. <lb/></div>
