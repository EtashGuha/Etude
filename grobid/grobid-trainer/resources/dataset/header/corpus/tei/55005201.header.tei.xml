	<div type="introduction">Today, control modules with more than 10,000 parameters are no<lb/> longer uncommon. Since numerous dynamic processes need to be<lb/> controlled in a vehicle, the typical tasks of ECU calibration include<lb/> optimization of control algorithms.<lb/> In the case of a PID controller, there are almost limitless possib-<lb/>le variations in calibrating the proportional, integral and derivati-<lb/>ve components. Therefore, it usually takes some effort until a suf-<lb/>ficiently good compromise is found between stability, speed and<lb/> transient behavior. This can be accomplished by reading and<lb/> modifying parameters during runtime (Figure 1).<lb/></div>
