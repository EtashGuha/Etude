	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Roll forming is a novel technique for manufacturing aircraft engine turbine disks. This paper describes an assessment of the technical and<lb/> economic viability of roll forming. The capabilities of roll forming will also be compared to those of hot die forging. It was found that there is<lb/> an economic pay-off for roll forming complex, low production-volume parts of nickel and titanium alloys due to a higher material yield and<lb/> less expensive tooling. Roll formed disks of high temperature nickel and titanium alloys were evaluated for dimensional control, metallurgical<lb/> structure, mechanical properties, and ultrasonic characteristics. The results from complex shapes indicate that disks can be produced with<lb/> uniform microstructures and excellent properties. The roll formed titanium disks possessed a–b-Ti microstructures with a mean grain size of<lb/> 5–10 mm. Electron back-scattering pattern analysis and inverse pole figure analyses indicated that the disks possessed essentially no<lb/> crystallographic texture. Samples machined from axial, radial, and tangential sections of disks were tested in order to evaluate any anisotropy<lb/> in mechanical properties of the disks.<lb/></div>
