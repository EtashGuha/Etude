		<div type="abstract">This paper presents an overview of mpi, a proposed <lb/>standard message passing interface for MIMD distributed memory concurrent computers. The design <lb/>of mpi has been a collective effort involving researchers <lb/>in the United States and Europe from many organizations and institutions. mpi includes point-to-point <lb/>and collective communication routines, as well as support for process groups, communication contexts, and <lb/>application topologies. While making use of new ideas <lb/>where appropriate, the mpi standard is based largely <lb/>on current practice. <lb/></div>
