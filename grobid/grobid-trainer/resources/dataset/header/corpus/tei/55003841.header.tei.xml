	<div type="abstract">[1] In experimental design, the main aim is to minimize postexperimental uncertainty<lb/> on parameters by maximizing relevant information collected in a data set. Using an<lb/> entropy-based method constructed on a Bayesian framework, it is possible to<lb/> design experiments for highly nonlinear problems. However, the method is<lb/> computationally infeasible for design spaces with even a few dimensions. We introduce an<lb/> iteratively constructive method that reduces the computational demand by introducing<lb/> one new datum at a time for the design. The method reduces the multidimensional design<lb/> space to a single-dimensional space at each iteration by fixing the experimental setup<lb/> of the previous iteration. Both a synthetic experiment using a highly nonlinear<lb/> parameter-data relationship and a seismic amplitude versus offset (AVO) experiment are<lb/> used to illustrate that the results produced by the iteratively constructive method<lb/> closely match the results of a global design method at a fraction of the computational cost.<lb/> This work thus extends the class of iterative design methods to nonlinear problems<lb/> and makes fully nonlinear design methods applicable to higher dimensional<lb/> real-world problems.<lb/> Citation: Guest, T., and A.
