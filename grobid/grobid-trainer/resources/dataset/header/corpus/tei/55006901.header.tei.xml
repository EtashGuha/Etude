	<div type="abstract">Abstract This paper discusses the planning and application of<lb/> expandable systems to provide effective open-hole sand<lb/> control with zonal isolation. It will present a case history of<lb/> the world&apos;s first completion set inside an expandable system to<lb/> provide a single selective well, where one could selectively<lb/> produce, or commingle from different zones. Control of the<lb/> formation sand was provided by expandable screen, open-hole<lb/> zonal isolation by expandable packers with solid pipe and a<lb/> conventional completion packer set inside expanded solid pipe<lb/> for selectivity. The expandable system was run in a synthetic<lb/> oil base drilling fluid that was used to inhibit swelling of<lb/> exposed shale.<lb/></div>
