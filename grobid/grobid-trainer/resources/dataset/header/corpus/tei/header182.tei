		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Drawing on on our work in the area of Distributed Artificial Intelligence, we propose the rudiments of a view of multiagent reasoning that relates current philosophical <lb/>intuitions, theoretical foundations, and preliminary implementation. The philosophical <lb/>position we take is a combination of Daniel Dennett&apos;s philosophy of the ladder of per-sonhood (consisting of rationality, intentionality, stance, reciprocity, communication, <lb/>and consciousness) on one hand, and the utilitarian philosophy of selfish utility maximization on the other hand. The theories we incorporate are logics of knowledge and <lb/>belief, which in addressing the multiagent issues can be developed based on a recursive <lb/>version of the Kripke structure, and the related fields of utility, decision and game <lb/>theories. Our preliminary implementation, the Recursive Modeling Method (RMM), <lb/>lets an agent coordinate its actions with the actions of other agents, cooperate with <lb/>them when appropriate, and rationally choose an optimal form of communication with <lb/>them. <lb/></div>
