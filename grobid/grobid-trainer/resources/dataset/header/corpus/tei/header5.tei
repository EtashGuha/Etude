		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In this paper we introduce a new approach to the deformation of surface and raster <lb/>models in two and three dimensions. Rather then deforming the objects in the <lb/>model, we deform the rays used to render the scene. The mechanism to specify the <lb/>deformation, which we call a deector, is a vector of gravity positioned in space. <lb/>This gravity vector bends any ray that travels through its field of gravity. Images <lb/>generated by these curved rays give the impression of a deformed space. Unlike <lb/>previous methods that deform all the objects in the scene, our approach deforms <lb/>only those parts of the model that contribute to the final image. In addition, using <lb/>deectors, our approach can deform any object type that can be rendered by a ray <lb/>casting algorithm, providing a unified solution to space deformation. <lb/></div>
