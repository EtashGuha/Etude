	<div type="abstract">A b s t r a c t<lb/> The aim of this study was to examine 29 strains of lactic acid bacteria of the Lactobacillus and Lactococcus genera,<lb/> assessing their sensitivity to ochratoxin A and their ability to remove it from a liquid medium. It was demonstrated that<lb/> most strains are insensitive to the presence of OTA at the quantity of 5 µg/disc. It was demonstrated that all strains<lb/> caused a reduction of the toxin amount in the liquid medium. The highest decrease, exceeding 50% of the initial OTA<lb/> content, was caused by the strains Lactobacillus acidophilus CH-5, L. rhamnosus GG, L. plantarum BS, L. brevis and<lb/> L. sanfranciscensis. The example of three selected strains confirmed the negative effect of the toxin on the dynamics of<lb/> bacterial growth. A sharp decrease of ochratoxin A was observed during the first 15 hours of culture growth. In the<lb/> course of cultivation the amount of the toxin in the medium increased, indicating that the toxin elimination is partially<lb/> reversible. A small quantity of ochratoxin A became bound to the bacterial biomass.<lb/></div>
