	<div type="introduction">At Typekit, we&apos;re working to deliver fonts in as many languages as possible, while continuing<lb/> to satisfy our core requirement: delivering fonts as fast as possible. There is one significant<lb/> challenge with that goal: As you support more and more languages, your character set (and<lb/> the size of your font files) gets larger and larger. Subsequently, the speed at which you can<lb/> deliver fonts decreases. So, the obvious aim would be to find a way to reduce the size of those<lb/> font files. But how?<lb/> One method is called dynamic subsetting. Dynamic subsetting, invented by Steve Lee at<lb/> Monotype, scans a web page to determine the actual characters in use. It then creates—on the<lb/> fly—a subsetted version of the requested fonts using only those characters, and stores this<lb/> version in a cache. Dynamic subsetting is a promising future direction, but there are<lb/> questions about the time it takes to scan the page, return the font, and cache the results. And<lb/> it&apos;s difficult to tell how well this approach will handle content that is dynamically created.<lb/> Another method is to deliver fonts by script, e.g., Latin, Arabic, or Cyrillic. But few fonts<lb/> support an entire script. If a font only partially supports the Latin-1 character set, how do you<lb/> know if it will deliver all the characters for the particular languages that your site supports?<lb/> Enter Speakeasy: Speakeasy is an open-source language tool that maps a range of unicode<lb/> symbols to a particular language. So, for example, if you are publishing a site in both German<lb/> and English, Speakeasy can provide a map of all the unicode symbols required to represent<lb/> those two languages. This map can then be used to determine if a particular font includes all<lb/> of the characters required to support these languages. In fact, we&apos;ve used Speakeasy to release<lb/> just such a feature on Typekit today.<lb/> You can now browse fonts by language support; in the Typekit sidebar, you&apos;ll see a list of<lb/> languages currently available.

	(That list includes English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese,<lb/> French, German, Polish, Swedish, Czech, Dutch, Catalan, and Russian; more languages

	are<lb/> coming soon.) Need a font that supports Spanish, Catalan, and Italian? Simply select all three<lb/> and you&apos;ll only see fonts that include characters required by all three languages.<lb/> New: browse by language support on Typekit.<lb/> We&apos;re really excited to release this feature; but we know it can be better. We&apos;ve done our best<lb/> to identify the absolute minimum set of required characters for each of these languages (you<lb/> can see which characters are included in each language here). But we&apos;re not native speakers of<lb/> many of these languages, so we can&apos;t be sure we&apos;ve gotten it right: that&apos;s where you come in.<lb/> We&apos;re releasing Speakeasy as an open-source project, so that developers from all over the<lb/> world can contribute to the character mappings and/or add new languages to the list. You can<lb/> retrieve the code from GitHub to start working right away. With your contribution, Speakeasy<lb/> Typekit RSS Feed<lb/> Typekit on Twitter<lb/> Recent Font Releases<lb/> 1.
