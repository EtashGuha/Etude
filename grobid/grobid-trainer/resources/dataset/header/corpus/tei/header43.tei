		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper describes a general architecture for an interactive model-based vision system. A <lb/>human specifies a limited amount of information which establishes a context for autonomous interpretation of images. Object models are described by constraints specifying necessary geometrical <lb/>properties and relationships between objects. The use of constraints allows for flexible object in-stantiation. A user can indicate an object in a scene and this directs perceptual processing routines <lb/>as well as constraining future object instantiations. This interactive model-based concept has been <lb/>applied to the domain of vehicle tracking, and this paper concludes with several processing examples <lb/>from this domain. <lb/></div>
