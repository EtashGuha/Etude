		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In this paper, we present new algorithms to balance <lb/>the computation of parallel hash joins over heterogeneous processors in the presence of data skew and external loads. Heterogeneity in our model consists of <lb/>disparate computing elements, as well as general purpose computing ensembles that are subject to external loading (e.g., a LAN connected workstation cluster). Data skew manifests itself as significant non-uniformities in the distribution of attribute values of <lb/>underlying relations that are involved in a join. <lb/>We develop cost models and predictive dynamic <lb/>load balancing protocols to detect imbalance during <lb/>the computation of a single large join. New predictive bucket scheduling algorithms are presented that <lb/>smooth out the load over the entire ensemble by reallocating buckets whenever imbalance is detected. Our <lb/>algorithms can account for imbalance due to data skew <lb/>as well as heterogeneity in the computing environment. <lb/>Significant performance gains are reported for a wide <lb/>range of test cases on a prototype implementation of <lb/>the system. <lb/></div>
