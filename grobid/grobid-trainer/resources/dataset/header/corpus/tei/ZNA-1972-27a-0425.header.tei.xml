	<div type="abstract">Electron diffraction from a perfect single crystal shows the influence of many-beam interaction.<lb/> Investigations with a single crystal wedge allow a direct analysis of the Bloch-waves which are dis-<lb/>played into their partial waves. The strength of the dynamical interactions in a MgO crystal wedge<lb/> was investigated by comparing the photographic record of a section through the dispersion surface<lb/> with many-beam calculations. For a direction of the incident beam near the [110] zone axis the<lb/> interaction of at least 50 beams has to be taken into account. Using a 50-beam calculation the<lb/> structure potential V1U was determined to 1.80 volts ±3%.<lb/> The influence of many-beam interactions on the absorption and the extinction fringe profiles in<lb/> electron micrographs is discussed. Analysis of extinction fringes on the basis of a 50-beam approxi-<lb/>mation allowed the determination of the mean absorbing potential F0 im of MgO to 0.7 volts ±10%.</div>
