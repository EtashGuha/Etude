		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We present new strategies for &quot;probably approximately correct&quot; (pac) learning that use <lb/>fewer training examples than previous approaches. The idea is to observe training examples one-at-a-time and decide &quot;on-line&quot; when to <lb/>return a hypothesis, rather than collect a large <lb/>fixed-size training sample. This yields sequential learning procedures that pac-learn by observing a small random number of examples. <lb/>We provide theoretical bounds on the expected <lb/>training sample size of our procedure | but establish its efficiency primarily by a series of experiments which show sequential learning actually uses many times fewer training examples in <lb/>practice. These results demonstrate that pac-learning can be far more efficiently achieved in <lb/>practice than previously thought. <lb/></div>
