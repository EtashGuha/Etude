		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Communication networks shared by selfish users are <lb/>considered and modeled as noncooperative repeated <lb/>games. Each user is interested only in optimizing its <lb/>own performance by controlling the routing of its load. <lb/>We investigate the existence of a NEP that achieves <lb/>the system-wide optimal cost. The existence of a NEP <lb/>that not only achieves the system-wide optimal cost but <lb/>also yields a cost for each user no greater than its stage <lb/>game NEP cost is shown for two-node multiple link networks. It is shown that more general networks where <lb/>all users have the same source-destination pair have <lb/>a NEP that achieves the minimum total system cost <lb/>under a mild technical condition. It is shown general <lb/>networks with users having multiple source-destination <lb/>pairs don&apos;t necessarily have such an NEP. <lb/></div>
