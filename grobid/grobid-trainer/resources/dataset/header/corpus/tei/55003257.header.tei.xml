	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT Inulin is a term applied to a heterogeneous blend of fructose polymers found widely distributed in<lb/> nature as plant storage carbohydrates. Oligofructose is a subgroup of inulin, consisting of polymers with a degree<lb/> of polymerization (DP) Յ10. Inulin and oligofructose are not digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract; therefore,<lb/> they have a reduced caloric value. They stimulate the growth of intestinal bifidobacteria. They do not lead to a rise<lb/> in serum glucose or stimulate insulin secretion. Several commercial grades of inulin are available that have a<lb/> neutral, clean flavor and are used to improve the mouthfeel, stability and acceptability of low fat foods. Oligofruc-<lb/>tose has a sweet, pleasant flavor and is highly soluble. It can be used to fortify foods with fiber without contributing<lb/> any deleterious organoleptic effects, to improve the flavor and sweetness of low calorie foods and to improve the<lb/> texture of fat-reduced foods. Inulin and oligofructose possess several functional and nutritional properties, which<lb/> may be used to formulate innovative healthy foods for today&apos;s consumer.</div>
