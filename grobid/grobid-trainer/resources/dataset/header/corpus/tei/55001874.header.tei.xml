	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT: Various polymer surfaces were analyzed for reactivity toward 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane<lb/> (APTES). Results indicate that the method described here is useful as a general surface-selective modification<lb/> technique for polar polymers such as polyesters, polyamides, polycarbonates, polyimides, cellulosics, polyacrylics,<lb/> etc. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed an average of 10% silicon and nitrogen atomic concentrations<lb/> at 75° takeoff for all successfully modified surfaces. The APTES multilayers were subsequently hydrophobized<lb/> with perfluorinated chlorosilanes giving 40% fluorine atomic concentration by XPS and 120°/90° (advancing/<lb/> receding) dynamic contact angle averages. APTES modifications were successful in all solvents with the exception<lb/> of protic solvents. On the basis of these and other observations, a new model for the reaction pathway is proposed.<lb/> We propose the reaction proceeds by initial APTES adsorption (likely through hydrogen bonding by the amine)<lb/> to the substrate, lateral bond formation, and subsequent multilayer formation. The model is thus analogous to<lb/> silane multilayer formation on silica.<lb/></div>
