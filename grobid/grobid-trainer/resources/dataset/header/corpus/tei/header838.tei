		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In a database system, read operations are much more <lb/>common than write operations, and consequently, database <lb/>systems have been read optimized. As the size of main memory increases, more of the database read requests will be satisfied from the buffer system, and the amount of disk write <lb/>operations relative to disk read operations will increase. <lb/>This calls for a focus on write optimized database systems. <lb/>In this paper, we present solutions to this problem. We describe in detail the data structures and algorithms needed <lb/>to realize a write optimized object-oriented database system <lb/>in the context of Vagabond, an OODB currently being implemented at our department. In Vagabond, focus has been <lb/>to provide support for applications which have earlier used <lb/>file systems because of the limited data bandwidth in current <lb/>database systems, typical examples are super computing applications and geographical information systems <lb/></div>
