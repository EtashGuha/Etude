	<div type="introduction">F<lb/> inding suitable restoration materials for<lb/> quarries where overburden is in scarce<lb/> supply can be difficult and costly. Even<lb/> restoration using inert waste materials<lb/> where placed in sensitive groundwater<lb/> environments under the provisions of the<lb/> Landfill Directive can result in the need for<lb/> long-term management care, and potential<lb/> liabilities.<lb/> A novel solution to restoration was<lb/> established at Lafarge Aggregates Ltd&apos;s<lb/> Whitwell Quarry, in Derbyshire, which sought<lb/> to both aid the restoration of the quarry and<lb/> improve the local environment through the<lb/> use of extractive waste materials comprising<lb/> colliery spoil. There is a range of technical and<lb/> operational challenges associated with the<lb/> use of such extractive waste material, and a<lb/> series of studies was carried out by MJCA to<lb/> assess the suitability of these materials for<lb/> their intended use through detailed<lb/> hydrogeological assessment of the risks to<lb/> controlled waters and to address the relevant<lb/> engineering, regulatory and permitting<lb/> requirements.<lb/> To the east of Whitwell Quarry lie two large<lb/> colliery spoil tips from former coal workings<lb/> in the area which date back to 1894 (fig. 1.).<lb/> The colliery spoil tips lie open to weathering<lb/> processes and there is evidence to suggest<lb/> that,<lb/> without ongoing<lb/> long-term<lb/> management, water draining from the spoil<lb/> tips has an impact on the quality of the nearby<lb/> watercourses and underlying groundwater.<lb/> The tips overlie a part of the dolomitic<lb/> limestone and prevent access to this valuable<lb/> mineral reserve. The solution sought was to<lb/> relocate the spoil from one of the tips,<lb/> named &apos;Belph Tip&apos;. This approach would not<lb/> only allow Lafarge to gain access to the<lb/> limestone reserves to the east of the main<lb/> quarry, but would also provide materials that<lb/> could be used in the restoration of the main<lb/> quarry and remove one of the spoil tips<lb/> which currently is affecting the local<lb/> environment.<lb/> At the quarry Lafarge excavate the<lb/> dolomitic limestone from two benches to<lb/> provide material for a kiln located at the site,<lb/> which produces high-grade refractory<lb/> products, and from a lower, third bench for<lb/> aggregate products. The limestone is a<lb/> principal aquifer supporting a number of<lb/> groundwater abstractions in the wider area.<lb/> Whitwell Quarry is also located close to<lb/> Cresswell Crags, which is a Site of Special<lb/> Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Scheduled<lb/> Ancient Monument (SAM). Cresswell Crags<lb/> comprises a number of prehistoric limestone<lb/> caves, containing important Palaeolithic<lb/> deposits, and a limestone gorge in which the<lb/> Crags Pond is formed by the Millwood Brook.<lb/> Colliery spoil is classified as an extractive<lb/> waste and is exempt from regulation under<lb/> the Landfill Directive and the waste-<lb/>management permitting regulations (WMPR),<lb/> which were in place at the time of application<lb/> for the relocation of colliery spoil to the<lb/> quarry. The assessment of risks to<lb/> groundwater from processes not covered by<lb/> the provisions in the WMPR, which may lead<lb/> to the indirect discharge of hazardous and<lb/> non-hazardous substances, is subject to the<lb/> 1998 Groundwater Regulations (since revoked<lb/> and replaced) and through the need to âž¤</div>
