		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper describes the application of Parallel Distributed Genetic Programming (PDGP) to the problem of inducing programs for natural language processing. <lb/>PDGP is a new form of Genetic Programming (GP) which is suitable for the development of programs with a high degree of parallelism and an efficient and effective <lb/>reuse of partial results. Programs are represented in PDGP as graphs with nodes <lb/>representing functions and terminals, and links representing the flow of control and <lb/>results. PDGP allows the exploration of a large space of possible programs including standard tree-like programs, logic networks, neural networks, finite state <lb/>automata, Recursive Transition Networks (RTNs), etc. The paper describes the <lb/>representations, the operators and the interpreters used in PDGP, and illustrates <lb/>its behaviour on the problem of inducing RTN-based recognisers for natural lan <lb/>guage from positive and negative examples. <lb/></div>
