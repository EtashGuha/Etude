		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Formal technical review (FTR) is an essential component of all modern software quality assessment, assurance, <lb/>and improvement techniques, and is acknowledged to be <lb/>the most cost-effective form of quality improvement when <lb/>practiced effectively. However, traditional FTR methods <lb/>such as inspection are very difficult to adopt in organizations: they introduce substantial new up-front costs, <lb/>training, overhead, and group process obstacles. Sustained commitment from high-level management along <lb/>with substantial resources is often necessary for successful <lb/>technology transfer of FTR. <lb/>Since 1991, we have been designing and evaluating <lb/>a series of versions of a system called CSRS: an instrumented, computer-supported cooperative work environment for formal technical review. The current version of <lb/>CSRS includes an FTR method definition language, which <lb/>allows organizations to design their own FTR method, <lb/>and to evolve it over time. This paper describes how our <lb/>approach to computer supported FTR can address some <lb/>of the issues in technology transfer of FTR. <lb/></div>
