		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Unlike wired links, wireless network bandwidth is highly limited <lb/>and the channel usually suffers from frequent and bursty loss due <lb/>to its vulnerability to various kinds of interference. At the same <lb/>time, the traditional TCP with its congestion control is well known <lb/>for its poor performance over wireless links. This paper proposes <lb/>a new protocol that (1) replaces TCP/IP over the wireless link by <lb/>a simpler protocol with smaller headers, if the link is the last hop <lb/>along a data path, (2) shifts functions needed to communicate with <lb/>an Internet host using TCP/IP from the mobile host to the base <lb/>station, so that the distinct wireless link is hidden from the outside Internet, and (3) exploits link-layer acknowledgments and re-transmissions to quickly recover losses over the wireless link. Our <lb/>simulation results show a substantial performance improvement <lb/>achieved by the new protocol. <lb/></div>
