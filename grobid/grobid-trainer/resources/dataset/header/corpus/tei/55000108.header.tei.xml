	<div type="abstract">Abstract. Atmospheric mineral dust particles can alter cloud<lb/> properties and thus climate by acting as cloud condensa-<lb/>tion nuclei (CCN) that form cloud droplets. The CCN ac-<lb/>tivation properties of various calcium mineral dust parti-<lb/>cles were studied experimentally to investigate the conse-<lb/>quences of field observations showing the segregation of<lb/> sulphate from nitrate and chloride between individual aged<lb/> Asian dust particles, and the enrichment of oxalic acid in<lb/> Asian dust. Each mineral&apos;s observed apparent hygroscop-<lb/>icity was primarily controlled by its solubility, which de-<lb/>termines the degree to which the mineral&apos;s intrinsic hygro-<lb/>scopicity can be expressed. The significant increase in hy-<lb/>groscopicity caused by mixing soluble hygroscopic material<lb/> with insoluble mineral particles is also presented. Insolu-<lb/>ble minerals including calcium carbonate, representing fresh<lb/> unprocessed dust, and calcium sulphate, representing atmo-<lb/>spherically processed dust, had similarly small apparent hy-<lb/>groscopicities. Their activation is accurately described by<lb/> a deliquescence limit following the Kelvin effect and cor-<lb/>responded to an apparent single-hygroscopicity parameter,<lb/> κ, of ∼0.001. Soluble calcium chloride and calcium ni-<lb/>trate, representing atmospherically processed mineral dust<lb/> particles, were much more hygroscopic, activating similar to<lb/> ammonium sulphate with κ∼0.5. Calcium oxalate monohy-<lb/>drate (κ=0.05) was significantly less CCN-active than oxalic<lb/> acid (κ=0.3), but not as inactive as its low solubility would<lb/> predict. These results indicate that the common assumption<lb/> that all mineral dust particles become more hygroscopic and<lb/> Correspondence to: K. A. Prather<lb/> (kprather@ucsd.edu)<lb/> CCN-active after atmospheric processing should be revis-<lb/>ited. Calcium sulphate and calcium oxalate are two realistic<lb/> proxies for aged mineral dust that remain non-hygroscopic.<lb/> The dust&apos;s apparent hygroscopicity will be controlled by its<lb/> chemical mixing state, which is determined by its mineral-<lb/>ogy and the chemical reaction pathways it experiences dur-<lb/>ing transport.<lb/></div>
