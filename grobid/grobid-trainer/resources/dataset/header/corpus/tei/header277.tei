		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper presents some of the underlying principles of description logics (also known <lb/>as terminological logics or kl-one-style languages), grounding them in the lattice of terms <lb/>organized by the so-called &quot;subsumption&quot; relationship. A survey of the increasingly varied uses <lb/>of description logics, including industrial applications, is presented by considering their role in <lb/>a number of different operations that one can apply to a knowledge base, including languages <lb/>for queries, answers, updates, rules, and constraints. Finally, we discuss some of the complexity <lb/>results related to the logics of descriptions, and survey a spectrum of responses to the many <lb/>intractability proofs. <lb/></div>
