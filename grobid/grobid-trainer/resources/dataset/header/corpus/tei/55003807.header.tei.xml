	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT. There is a growing interest in the role that cancer biomarkers, metastasis-related molecules, and<lb/> chemokines may play in the development and progression of various cancers. However, few studies have<lb/> addressed the reliability of such biomarkers in healthy individuals over time. The objective of this study was to<lb/> investigate the temporal reliability of multiple proteins in serum samples from healthy women who donated<lb/> blood over successive years. Thirty five, postmenopausal women with two, repeated annual visits, and thirty,<lb/> premenopausal women with three, repeated annual visits were randomly selected among eligible subjects from<lb/> an existing, prospective cohort. Multiplexing Luminex xMAP<lb/> TM technology was used to measure the levels of<lb/> 55 serum proteins representing cancer antigens, chemokines, angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors, proteases,<lb/> adipokines, apoptotic molecules, and other markers in these women. The biomarkers with high detection rates<lb/> (&gt; 60%) and acceptable reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICCs ≥ 0.55) using xMAP<lb/> TM method were:<lb/> cancer antigens: AFP, CA 15-3, CEA, CA-125, SCC, SAA; growth factors/related molecules: ErbB2, IGFBP-1;<lb/> proteases and adhesion molecules: MMP-1, 8, 9, sE-selectin, human kallikreins (KLK) 8,10, ICAM-1, VCAM-1,<lb/> chemokines: fractalkine, MCP-1,2, RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, Eotaxin, GRO-α, IP-10; inhibitors of angiogene-<lb/>sis: angiostatin and endostatin; adipokines leptin and resistin; apoptotic factor: Fas, and other proteins<lb/> mesothelin, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and PAI-1. The rest of the biomarkers under investigation either had<lb/> ICCs less than 0.55 or had low levels of detection (&lt; 60%). These included cancer antigens:

	CA 19-9, CA 72-4,<lb/> MICA, S100, TTR, ULBP1, ULBP2, ULBP3;

	proteases: MMP 2, 3, 7, 12, 13; chemokines: MCP-3, MIF, MIG;<lb/> adipokines: leptin and resistin; apoptotic factors: FasL, DR5, Cyfra 21-1; and inhibitors of angiogenesis and<lb/> other markers: thrombospondin and heat shock protein (HSP) 27. In conclusion, 34 out of the 55 biomarkers<lb/> investigated were present in detectable levels in &gt; 60% of the samples, and with an ICC ≥0.55, indicating that a<lb/> single serum measurement can be used in prospective epidemiological studies using the xMAP<lb/> TM method.<lb/></div>
