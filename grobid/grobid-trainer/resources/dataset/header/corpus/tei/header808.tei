		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper first gives an overview of standard PROLOG indexing and <lb/>then shows, in a step-by-step manner, how it can be improved by slightly <lb/>extending the WAM indexing instruction set to allow indexing on multiple <lb/>arguments. Heuristics are described that overcome the difficulty of computing the indexing WAM code. In order to become independent from a <lb/>concrete WAM instruction set, an abstract graphical representation based <lb/>on DAGs (called DAXes) is introduced. <lb/>The paper includes a COMMON LISP listing of the main heuristics <lb/>implemented; the algorithms were developed for RELFUN, a relational-plus-functional language, but can easily be used in arbitrary PROLOG <lb/>implementations. <lb/></div>
