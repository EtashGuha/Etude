	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Improve signal anomaly detection for ISHM system, in which the system is self-monitoring. In<lb/> particular improve detection of spikes and noisy regions of signals. Researched statistical analysis of<lb/> measurements using kurtosis and skewness in order to develop algorithms to detect noise and spikes.<lb/> Also researched spectral analysis of signals, as well as statistical analysis of the spectral data in order to<lb/> develop algorithms. Two spike detection algorithms were created analyzing the spectral data, as well as<lb/> one noise detection algorithm. Skewness of measurements was useful in removing false positives from<lb/> detection for noise.<lb/></div>
