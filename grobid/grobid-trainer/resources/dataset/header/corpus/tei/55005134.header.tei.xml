			<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has long been
				the<lb/> de-facto standard for nonlinear state space estimation<lb/> [11], primarily
				due to its simplicity, robustness and<lb/> suitability for realtime implementations.
				However, an<lb/> alternative approach has emerged over the last few<lb/> years,
				namely the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). This<lb/> filter claims both higher
				accuracy and robustness for<lb/> nonlinear models. Several papers have investigated
				the<lb/> accuracy of UKF for nonlinear process models, but<lb/> none has addresses
				the accuracy for nonlinear mea-<lb/> surement models in particular. This paper
				claims to<lb/> bridge this gap by comparing the performance of EKF<lb/> to UKF for
				two tracking models having nonlinear mea-<lb/> surements.<lb/></div>
