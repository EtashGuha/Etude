			<div type="abstract">The structure of molten LaBr3 was investigated by X-ray diffraction and molecular dynamics simu- <lb/>
lations. It was found that the short range structure of molten LaBr3 is very similar to that of molten <lb/>
LaCl^, except for some structural features such as interionic distances based on the difference of anion <lb/>
sizes. In the MD simulation, the shear viscosity of molten LaBr-^ was estimated from the structurally- <lb/>
optimized MD calculations. <lb/></div>
