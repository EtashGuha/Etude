		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Object recognition, which involves the classification of objects into one of many a priori known object types, and determining object characteristics such as pose, is a difficult <lb/>problem. A wide range of approaches have been proposed and applied to this problem with <lb/>limited success. This paper presents a brief comparative study of methods from three different paradigms for object recognition: Bayesian, Neural Network and Expert Systems. <lb/></div>
