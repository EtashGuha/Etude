	<div type="abstract">Abstract. In software engineering as well as in any engineering do-<lb/>main, a way of customizing the collaborative work to various modes of<lb/> collaboration, i.e. synchronous and asynchronous, and the possibility of<lb/> alternating these modes along the phases of a project is required. Our<lb/> goal is to develop a universal information platform that can support<lb/> collaboration in a range of application domains, the basic sharing unit<lb/> being the document. Since not all user groups have the same conventions<lb/> and not all tasks have the same requirements, this implies that it should<lb/> be possible to customize the collaborative environment at the level of<lb/> both communities and individual tasks. In this paper we present the<lb/> consistency maintenance models underlying the synchronous and asyn-<lb/>chronous modes of collaboration. We highlight the importance of choos-<lb/>ing a general structured model of the document and particularly analyze<lb/> the multi-mode collaboration for two main representative types of doc-<lb/>uments: textual and graphical.<lb/></div>
