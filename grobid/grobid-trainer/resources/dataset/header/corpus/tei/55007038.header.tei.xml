	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The enzyme vitamin K 1 2,3 epoxide reductase is responsible for converting vitamin K 1 2,3<lb/> epoxide to vitamin K 1 quinone thus completing the vitamin K cycle. The enzyme is also the<lb/> target of inhibition by the oral anticoagulant, R,S-warfarin. Purification of this protein would<lb/> enable the interaction of the inhibitor with its target to be elucidated. To date a single protein<lb/> possessing vitamin K 1 2,3 epoxide reductase activity and binding R,S-warfarin has yet to be<lb/> purified to homogeneity, but recent studies have indicated that the enzyme is in fact at least<lb/> two interacting proteins. We report on the attempted purification of the vitamin K 1 2,3 epoxide<lb/> reductase complex from rat liver microsomes by ion exchange and size exclusion chromato-<lb/>graphy techniques. The intact system consisted of a warfarin-binding factor, which possessed<lb/> no vitamin K 1 2,3 epoxide reductase activity and a catalytic protein. This catalytic protein was<lb/> purified 327-fold and was insensitive to R,S-warfarin inhibition at concentrations up to 5 mM.<lb/> The addition of the S-200 size exclusion chromatography fraction containing the inhibitor-<lb/>binding factor resulted in the return of R,S-warfarin inhibition. Thus, to function normally, the<lb/> rat liver endoplasmic reticulum vitamin K 1 2,3 epoxide reductase system requires the association<lb/> of two components, one with catalytic activity for the conversion of the epoxide to the quinone<lb/> and the second, the inhibitor binding factor. This latter enzyme forms the thiol-disulphide<lb/> redox centre that in the oxidized form binds R,S-warfarin.<lb/></div>
