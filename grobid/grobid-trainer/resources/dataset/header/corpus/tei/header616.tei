		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper presents a study of the statistical characteristics and multiplexing of Variable-Bit-Rate (VBR) <lb/>MPEG-coded video streams. Our results are based on <lb/>23 minutes of video obtained from the entertainment <lb/>movie, The Wizard of Oz. The experimental setup <lb/>which was used to capture, digitize, and compress the <lb/>video stream is described. Although the study is conducted at the frame level (as opposed to the slice level), <lb/>it is observed that the inter-frame correlation structure for the frame-size sequence involves complicated <lb/>forms of pseudo-periodicity that are mainly affected <lb/>by the compression pattern of the sequence. A simple model for an MPEG traffic source is developed in <lb/>which frames are generated according to the compression pattern of the original captured video stream. The <lb/>number of cells per frame is fitted by a lognormal distribution. Simulations are used to study the performance of an ATM multiplexer for MPEG streams. <lb/></div>
