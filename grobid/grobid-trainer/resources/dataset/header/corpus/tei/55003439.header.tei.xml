	<div type="abstract">Polyethylenimine (PEI) shows high transfection efficiency and cytoxicity due to its high amine density. The new<lb/> disulfide cationic polymer, linear poly(ethylenimine sulfide) (l-PEIS), was synthesized for efficient and safe gene<lb/> delivery. As the amine density of l-PEIS increased, the transfection efficiency also increased. l-PEIS-6 and l-PEIS-8<lb/> show transfection efficiencies that are similar to that of PEI. However, cytotoxicity of l-PEIS was not observed<lb/> due to the biodegradable disulfide bond. The disulfide bonds are stable in the oxidative extracellular condition<lb/> and can be degraded rapidly in the reductive intracellular condition. The degradation of l-PEIS in HeLa cells was<lb/> visualized by fluorescence microscopy using the probe-probe dequenching effect of BODIPY-FL fluorescence<lb/> dye. l-PEIS was degraded completely within 3 h.<lb/></div>
