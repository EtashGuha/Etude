	<div type="abstract"><lb/> In mathematics, and computational geometry, a Delaunay triangulation or Delone<lb/> triangularization for a set P of points in the plane is a triangulation DT(P) such that no point in<lb/> P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in DT(P). Delaunay triangulations maximize the<lb/> minimum angle of all the angles of the triangles in the triangulation; they tend to avoid &quot;sliver&quot;<lb/> triangles. The triangulation was invented by Boris Delaunay in 1934<lb/> [1] .<lb/> Based on Delaunay&apos;s definition<lb/> [1] , the circumcircle of a triangle formed by three points from the<lb/> original point set is empty if it does not contain vertices other than the three that define it (other<lb/> points are permitted only on the very perimeter, not inside).<lb/> The Delaunay condition states that a triangle net is a Delaunay triangulation if all the<lb/> circumcircles of all the triangles in the net are empty. This is the original definition for<lb/> bidimensional spaces. It is possible to use it in tridimensional spaces by using a circumscribed<lb/> sphere in place of the circumference.<lb/> For a set of points on the same line there is no Delaunay triangulation (in fact, the notion of triangulation is undefined for this<lb/> case).<lb/> For 4 points on the same circle (e.g., the vertices of a rectangle) the Delaunay triangulation is not unique: clearly, the two possible<lb/> triangulations that split the quadrangle into two triangles satisfy the Delaunay condition.<lb/> Generalizations are possible to metrics other than Euclidean. However in these cases a Delaunay triangulation is not guaranteed to<lb/> exist or be unique.<lb/></div>
