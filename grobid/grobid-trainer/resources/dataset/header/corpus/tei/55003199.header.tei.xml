	<div type="abstract">a b s t r a c t<lb/> The development of efficient microbial processes for the production of flavonoids has been a metabolic<lb/> engineering goal for the past several years, primarily due to the purported health-promoting effects of<lb/> these compounds. Although significant strides have been made recently in improving strain titers and<lb/> yields, current fermentation strategies suffer from two major drawbacksâ€”(1) the requirement for<lb/> expensive phenylpropanoic precursors supplemented into the media and (2) the need for two separate<lb/> media formulations for biomass/protein generation and flavonoid production. In this study, we detail<lb/> the construction of a series of strains capable of bypassing both of these problems. A four-step<lb/> heterologous pathway consisting of the enzymes tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL), 4-coumarate:CoA<lb/> ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and chalcone isomerase (CHI) was assembled within two<lb/> engineered L-tyrosine Escherichia coli overproducers in order to enable the production of the main<lb/> flavonoid precursor naringenin directly from glucose. During the course of this investigation, we<lb/> discovered that extensive optimization of both enzyme sources and relative gene expression levels was<lb/> required to achieve high quantities of both p-coumaric acid and naringenin accumulation. Once this<lb/> metabolic balance was achieved, however, such strains were found to be capable of producing 29 mg/l<lb/> naringenin from glucose and up to 84 mg/l naringenin with the addition of the fatty acid enzyme<lb/> inhibitor, cerulenin. These results were obtained through cultivation of E. coli in a single minimal<lb/> medium formulation without additional precursor supplementation, thus paving the way for the<lb/> development of a simple and economical process for the microbial production of flavonoids directly<lb/> from glucose.<lb/></div>
