	<div type="introduction">OHROPAX Classic has been an established noise<lb/> protection product since 1907. The unique<lb/> formulation – cotton wool soaked in a mixture of<lb/> Vaseline and paraffin wax – was so perfect right from<lb/> the outset that it has remained practically unchanged<lb/> up until the present day.<lb/> The ingredients are gentle to the skin and<lb/> hypoallergenic. The ear plugs can also be ideally<lb/> adjusted to fit every auditory canal and considerably<lb/> reduce the effects of noise pollution. The wearing<lb/> comfort is excellent as no sensation of pressure<lb/> occurs in the ear. The snug material adheres well to<lb/> the skin and enables secure positioning. The flesh-<lb/>colored ear plugs look discreet when worn.<lb/></div>
