		<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT <lb/>Research and development efforts in the parallel and <lb/>distributed simulation field over the last 15 years <lb/>has progressed, largely independently, in two separate camps: the largely academic high performance <lb/>Parallel And Distributed (discrete event) Simulation (PADS) community, and the DoD-centered Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) community. <lb/>This tutorial gives an overview and comparison of <lb/>work in these two areas, emphasizing issues related to <lb/>distributed execution where these fields have the most <lb/>overlap. Differences in the fundamental assumptions <lb/>routinely used within each community are contrasted, <lb/>followed by overviews of work in each community. <lb/></div>
