	<div type="abstract">Summary<lb/> An enzyme immunoassay for prostaglandin Fza was developed in which the<lb/> hapten molecule was labeled with alkaline phosphatase protein. After competi-<lb/>tion between the enzyme-labeled prostaglandin Fzo, and the free prostaglandin<lb/> F in their immunoreaction with prostaglandin F,,-specific antiserum, the<lb/> ar%genantibody conjugate was precipitated by the double antibody method,<lb/> and the activity of precipitated alkaline phosphatase was determined. Calibra-<lb/>tion curves of enzyme activity versus the amount of added prostaglandin Fzo,<lb/> were constructed. Under optimal conditions of pH, buffer concentration, incu-<lb/>bation time and amount of antibody and enzyme-labeled antigen, prostaglandin<lb/> Fzcl could be measured quantitatively in the range of 0.5 pmol to 1 nmol. This<lb/> method was applied for the determinations of prostaglandin Fzo, added to<lb/> urine.<lb/> __-_<lb/></div>
