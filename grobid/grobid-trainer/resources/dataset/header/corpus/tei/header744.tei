		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Recent attempts at incorporating concurrency into functional languages have <lb/>identified synchronous communication via shared channels as a promising primitive. An additional useful feature found in many proposals is a nondeterministic <lb/>choice operator. Similar in nature to the CSP alternative command, this operator <lb/>allows different possible actions to be guarded by sends or receives. Choice is <lb/>difficult to implement in a distributed environment because it requires offering <lb/>many potential communications but closing only one. In this paper we present <lb/>the first distributed, deadlock-free algorithm for choice. <lb/></div>
