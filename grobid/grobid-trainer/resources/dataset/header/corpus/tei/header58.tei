		<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT <lb/>This paper evaluates several hardware platforms and operating systems using a set of benchmarks <lb/>that stress kernel entry/exit, file systems, and other things related to operating systems. The <lb/>overall conclusion is that operating system performance is not improving at the same rate as the <lb/>base speed of the underlying hardware. The most obvious ways to remedy this situation are to <lb/>improve memory bandwidth and reduce operating systems&apos; tendency to wait for disk operations to <lb/>complete. <lb/></div>
