		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We present in this paper a comparison of the dispersion properties for several finite-difference approximations of the acoustic wave equation. We investigate the compact and <lb/>staggered schemes of fourth order accuracy in space and of second order or fourth order accuracy in time. We derive the computational cost of the simulation implied by a precision <lb/>criterion on the numerical simulation (maximum allowed error in phase or group velocity). <lb/>We conclude that for moderate accuracy the staggered scheme of second order in time is more <lb/>efficient, whereas for very precise simulation the compact scheme of fourth order in time is <lb/>a better choice. The comparison increasingly favors the lower order staggered scheme as the <lb/>dimension increases. In three dimensional simulation, the cost of extremely precise simulation with any of the schemes is very large, whereas for simulation of moderate precision the <lb/>staggered scheme is the least expensive. <lb/></div>
