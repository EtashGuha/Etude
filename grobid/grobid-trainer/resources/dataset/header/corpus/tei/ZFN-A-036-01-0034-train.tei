			<div type="abstract">Ab initio calculations of double zeta quality have been reported for the conjugated 5- and 6- <lb/>
membered ring heterocycles containing NH and NMe groups. The electric field gradients were <lb/>
calculated and the derived nuclear quadrupole coupling constants (NQCC) compared, both in <lb/>
magnitude and direction, with those obtained by microwave spectroscopy and by nuclear quadru- <lb/>
pole resonance. A comparison of the results with those of the corresponding O- and S-heterocycles, <lb/>
and with acyclic compounds has been given, and it was shown that aromaticity considerations <lb/>
were of no relevance to the NQOC values at pyridine-like N; planarity of the N atom at AM in the <lb/>
systems 2câ€”9c is responsible for the very low magnitude of Xnt and this is clearly associated with <lb/>
level of ^-donation from N-l; this is a function of position of the other ring N atoms, and <lb/>
appears to become saturated as the ring positions become predominantly N. In particular three <lb/>
contiguous N atoms seem to have less effect than two N atoms. <lb/></div>
