		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Multi-chip module (MCM) packaging techniques present several new technical challenges, notably substrate testing. We formulate MCM substrate testing as a problem of connectivity verification in trees via k-probes, and present a linear-time algorithm which computes a minimum <lb/>set of probes achieving complete open fault coverage. Since actual substrate testing also involves <lb/>scheduling probe operations, we formulate efficient probe scheduling as a special type of metric <lb/>traveling salesman optimization and give a provably-good heuristic. Empirical results using both <lb/>random and industry benchmarks demonstrate reductions in testing costs of up to 21% over previous methods. We conclude with generalizations to alternate probe technologies and several open <lb/>problems. <lb/></div>
