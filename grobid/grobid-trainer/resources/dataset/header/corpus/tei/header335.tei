		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper describes several key trends in technology that will inuence the design of file systems for the next decade. It first outlines the basic trends to hardware performance that underlie <lb/>file system design. These trends affect both user demands on file systems and trade-offs in their <lb/>design. It then considers how technologies will drive more demanding file system workloads that <lb/>will require scalable file systems. Next, it outlines how opportunities raised by these low-level <lb/>technology trends impact specific aspects of the xFS file systems serverless design [Dahlin <lb/>et al., 1994b, Anderson et al., 1996]. Finally, to put xFSs serverless approach in context, it discusses other technology trends that affect file systems but that are not explicitly addressed in the <lb/>serverless design. <lb/></div>
