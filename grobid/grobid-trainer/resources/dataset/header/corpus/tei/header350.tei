		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Kinetic simulation of plasmas in which equilibrium occurs over ion timescales poses <lb/>a computational challenge due to the disparate timescales of the electron plasma frequency (~ 10 9 ), the ion plasma frequency (~ 10 7 ), ion transit frequency (~ 10 6 ), and <lb/>the ionization frequency (~ 10 7 ). Hybrid electrostatic PIC algorithms are presented <lb/>in which the electrons reach thermodynamic equilibrium with the ions each time step. <lb/>There are two different approximations for the electrons. First, the nonlinear Boltzmann relationship for the electrons can be applied to the bulk of a plasma. Second, <lb/>there is a truncated Maxwellian which is used in sheaths; this approximation truncates <lb/>the electron distribution at the wall potential. The error associated with neglecting <lb/>this second approximation in the sheath is small. The collision cross section, (E), can <lb/>be a tabulated or fitted function; the method is implemented with He cross sections. <lb/>These approximations neglect effects faster than ion time-scales, decreasing the computer time used by over an order of magnitude; however, they increase the complexity <lb/>of the boundary conditions and the simulation is no longer self-consistent. Theoretical <lb/>ramifications of these approximations are examined, and results are compared with full <lb/></div>
