		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In recent years, researchers have been dedicated to the <lb/>study of underactuated manipulators which have more <lb/>joints than control actuators. In previous works, <lb/>assumptions were made as to the existence of enough <lb/>dynamic coupling between the active and the passive <lb/>joints of the manipulator for it to be possible to control <lb/>the position of the passive joints via the dynamic <lb/>coupling. In this work, the authors aim to develop an <lb/>index to measure the dynamic coupling, so as to address <lb/>when control of the underactuated system is possible, <lb/>and how the motion and robot configuration can be <lb/>designed. We discuss extensively the nature of the <lb/>dynamic coupling and of the proposed coupling index, <lb/>and their applications in the analysis and design of <lb/>underactuated systems, and in control and planning of <lb/>robot motion configuration. <lb/></div>
