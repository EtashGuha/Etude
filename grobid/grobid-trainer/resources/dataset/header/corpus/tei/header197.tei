		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper attempts to exemplify the advantages of perceptually grounded semantics with respect to traditional formalist approaches in elucidating the nature of the <lb/>controversial notion of linguistic polysemy, or multiplicity of meaning. It is also suggested how some aspects of language typically associated with compositionality could <lb/>be modeled, without there being a strictly &quot;compositional semantics&quot;. <lb/>This is done through a series of experiments, using modifications of Terry Regier&apos;s <lb/>connectionist system for learning spatial relations [Regier, 1992] which constitutes a <lb/>part of the L 0 project concerned with associating descriptions in an arbitrary language <lb/>with an analog environment, (sequences of) pictures of simple 2-dimensional scenes. <lb/>The emphasis is above all on the English preposition `over&apos;, famous for its poly-semy, and analyzed in detail by [Brugman, 1981] and [Lakoff, 1987], but some modeling has been also done of the meaning of `under&apos;, as well as some rudimentary <lb/>semantics for simple verbs such as `be&apos;, `go&apos; and `fly&apos; that combine with the two <lb/>prepositions. <lb/></div>
