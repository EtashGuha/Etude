	<div type="abstract">In this work, the catalytic efficiency of ionic liquid (IL) choline chloride/urea supported on<lb/> molecular sieves for the reactions of CO 2 and epoxides was studied under different conditions. It<lb/> was demonstrated that this biodegradable and green catalyst is very active and selective, and<lb/> choline chloride and urea showed a synergetic effect in promoting these reactions. After reaction,<lb/> the solid catalyst and the products could be separated easily because the IL was insoluble in the<lb/> products, and the catalyst was reusable. The origin of the high catalytic efficiency and the reaction<lb/> mechanism were also discussed.<lb/></div>
