		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The Hamiltonian dynamics of spherically symmetric massive thin shells <lb/>in the general relativity is considered. Two different constraint dynamical <lb/>systems representing this dynamics have been described recently; the relation <lb/>of these two systems is investigated. The symmetry groups of both systems <lb/>are found. The systems are reduced to the presymplectic manifolds 1 and 2 , <lb/>lest non-physical aspects like gauge fixings or embeddings in extended phase <lb/>spaces hinder the argument. The following facts are shown. 1 is three- and 2 <lb/>is five-dimensional; the description of the shell dynamics by 1 is incomplete <lb/>so that some measurable properties of the shell cannot be predicted. 1 is <lb/>locally equivalent to a subsystem of 2 and the corresponding local morphisms <lb/>are not unique, due to the large symmetry group of 2 . The local equivalence <lb/>explains why the same radial equation results from both systems; what is, <lb/>however, the physical importance of just local, but not global equivalence of <lb/>constraint dynamical systems remains unclear. <lb/></div>
