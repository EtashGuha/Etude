	<div type="abstract">Summary<lb/> Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be ex-<lb/>tremely important for deciphering the impact of genetic<lb/> variation on complex human diseases. The ultimate<lb/> value of SNPs for linkage and association mapping stud-<lb/>ies depends in part on the distribution of SNP allele<lb/> frequencies and intermarker linkage disequilibrium (LD)<lb/> across populations. Limited information is available<lb/> about these distributions on a genomewide scale, par-<lb/>ticularly for LD. Using 114 SNPs from 33 genes, we<lb/> compared these distributions in five American popula-<lb/>tions (727 individuals) of African, European, Chinese,<lb/> Hispanic, and Japanese descent. The allele frequencies<lb/> were highly correlated across populations but differed<lb/> by 120% for at least one pair of populations in 35%<lb/> of SNPs. The correlation in LD was high for some pairs<lb/> of populations but not for others (e.g., Chinese American<lb/> or Japanese American vs. any other population). Re-<lb/>gardless of population, average minor-allele frequencies<lb/> were significantly higher for SNPs in noncoding regions<lb/> (20%–25%) than for SNPs in coding regions<lb/> (12%–16%). Interestingly, we found that intermarker<lb/> LD may be strongest with pairs of SNPs in which both<lb/> markers are nonconservative substitutions, compared to<lb/> pairs of SNPs where at least one marker is a conservative<lb/> substitution. These results suggest that population dif-<lb/>ferences and marker location within the gene may be<lb/> important factors in the selection of SNPs for use in the<lb/> study of complex disease with linkage or association<lb/> mapping methods.<lb/></div>
