	<div type="introduction">Vascular changes are consistent early findings in patients with SSc<lb/> and often precede the development of fibrosis. Despite a signifi-<lb/>cant reduction in the capillary density, there is paradoxically no suf-<lb/>ficient angiogenesis in the skin of SSc patients. By using a pO 2<lb/> histograph, we showed that low pO 2 values are overt in involved<lb/> skin of patients with SSc. In vitro, real-time PCR revealed a<lb/> 3.7-fold upregulation of the potent angiogenic growth factor VEGF<lb/> in SSc fibroblasts after hypoxic exposure compared to normoxic<lb/> controls. In situ hybridization for VEGF in skin biopsies of patients<lb/> with SSc showed an overexpression of VEGF mRNA by fibroblasts<lb/> and mononuclear infiltrates, whereas its expression was limited to<lb/> keratinocytes in healthy control biopsies. In contrast to the SSc<lb/> skin, HIF-1 alpha protein was found to be coexpressed with VEGF<lb/> in healthy skin samples, indicating that the constitutive VEGF syn-<lb/>thesis in the skin is driven by this transcription factor. Additionally,<lb/> we showed that the lack of angiogenesis in SSc is not due to a<lb/> reduced bioavailability of the overexpressed VEGF, since the<lb/> VEGF receptors Flk-1 and Flt-1 were found to be expressed on<lb/> endothelial cells of patients with SSc, but not in healthy controls,<lb/> and since SSc patients had severely elevated serum levels of<lb/> VEGF compared to healthy controls. Despite the enhanced levels<lb/> of VEGF, serum samples of SSc patients did not induce angiogen-<lb/>esis in the vivo chorion allantois membrane assay, indicating that<lb/> the proangiogenic effects of VEGF may be outweighed by angio-<lb/>static factors. The hypothesis that VEGF synthesis has to be above<lb/> an individual threshold in SSc patients to induce angiogenesis was<lb/> further strengthened by the finding that patients without fingertip<lb/> ulcers had significantly higher levels than patients with fingertip<lb/> ulcers. Interestingly, the angiostatic factor endostatin was elevated<lb/> in a subset of patients and thus may counteract directly the bio-<lb/>logic effects of VEGF in SSc patients. Serum levels of VEGF were<lb/> also correlated significantly with disease severity parameters<lb/> including antitopoisomerase antibodies. These results suggest that<lb/> therapeutic application of VEGF by either gene transfer or as a<lb/> recombinant protein might be a novel option in SSc.<lb/></div>

	<div type="introduction">Objective: Most of the older descriptions of the synovial infiltrate<lb/> are based on examination of synovial tissue (ST) obtained at<lb/> surgery. However, ST from end-stage destructive rheumatoid<lb/> arthritis (RA) and arthroscopic biopsies obtained during active<lb/> inflammation could exhibit different characteristics. The aim of this<lb/> study was to define the cell infiltrate, the expression of proinflam-<lb/>matory cytokines, angiogenic factors, and matrix metallopro-<lb/>teinases in ST selected at arthroscopy compared with ST from<lb/> end-stage RA obtained at joint replacement.<lb/> Methods: Synovial biopsy specimens were obtained from the<lb/> actively inflamed knee joints of 11 RA patients with longstanding<lb/> RA by arthroscopy and compared with ST from 13 patients with<lb/> end stage, destructive RA requiring joint surgery. Use of medica-<lb/>tion was on average similar in the 2 groups. Immunohistologic<lb/> analysis was performed using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to<lb/> detect T cells, plasma cells, macrophages, fibroblast-like synovio-<lb/>cytes (FLS), as well as the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α,<lb/> matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, tissue<lb/> inhibitor of matrixmetalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, and vascular<lb/> endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The integrated optical density<lb/> was evaluated by computer-assisted image analysis.<lb/> Results: The expression of CD68+ macrophages was significantly<lb/> higher in ST selected at arthroscopy compared to samples<lb/> obtained at surgery, both in the intimal lining layer and in the sublin-<lb/>ing layer. The expression of CD3+ T cells also tended to be higher<lb/> in arthroscopic samples. There was no clear difference in the<lb/> expression of CD38 + plasma cells and CD55 + FLS. The expres-<lb/>sion for TNF-α, IL-6, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, TIMP-1, and VEGF<lb/> was on average higher in ST obtained at arthroscopy. The expres-<lb/>sion of IL-1β was on average higher in ST obtained at surgery.<lb/> Meeting abstracts</div>
