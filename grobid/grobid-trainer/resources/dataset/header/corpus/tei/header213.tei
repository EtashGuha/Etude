		<div type="abstract">Abstract: A Hybrid Intelligent Architecture that aims to exploit the complementary features of <lb/>expert systems and connectionist architecture, is proposed to revise input characterization and initial <lb/>domain knowledge. HIA has two building blocks, a Rule-Based module and a Connectionist Architecture <lb/>module. A specific format for the rule-based description of the initial theory acquired from the application <lb/>domain enables its mapping into a uniform, three layer network. Continuous inputs are discretized into <lb/>input vectors using a new coarse coding scheme. An extension of the Backpropagation Algorithm allows <lb/>refinement of the discretization functions. A successful application to the control of dams on the Colorado <lb/>river near Austin, is described. <lb/></div>
