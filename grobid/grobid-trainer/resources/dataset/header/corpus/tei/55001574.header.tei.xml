	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Background: Recent studies have shown that DNA methylation (DNAm) markers in peripheral blood may hold promise as<lb/> diagnostic or early detection/risk markers for epithelial cancers. However, to date no study has evaluated the diagnostic and<lb/> predictive potential of such markers in a large case control cohort and on a genome-wide basis.<lb/> Principal Findings: By performing genome-wide DNAm profiling of a large ovarian cancer case control cohort, we here<lb/> demonstrate that active ovarian cancer has a significant impact on the DNAm pattern in peripheral blood. Specifically, by<lb/> measuring the methylation levels of over 27,000 CpGs in blood cells from 148 healthy individuals and 113 age-matched pre-<lb/>treatment ovarian cancer cases, we derive a DNAm signature that can predict the presence of active ovarian cancer in blind<lb/> test sets with an AUC of 0.8 (95% CI (0.74–0.87)). We further validate our findings in another independent set of 122 post-<lb/>treatment cases (AUC = 0.76 (0.72–0.81)). In addition, we provide evidence for a significant number of candidate risk or early<lb/> detection markers for ovarian cancer. Furthermore, by comparing the pattern of methylation with gene expression data<lb/> from major blood cell types, we here demonstrate that age and cancer elicit common changes in the composition of<lb/> peripheral blood, with a myeloid skewing that increases with age and which is further aggravated in the presence of ovarian<lb/> cancer. Finally, we show that most cancer and age associated methylation variability is found at CpGs located outside of<lb/> CpG islands.<lb/> Significance: Our results underscore the potential of DNAm profiling in peripheral blood as a tool for detection or risk-<lb/>prediction of epithelial cancers, and warrants further in-depth and higher CpG coverage studies to further elucidate this<lb/> role.<lb/> </div>
