	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The first exon of the human androgen receptor (AR) contains a translated CAG (poly-glutamine) repeat. The repeat length is<lb/> polymorphic in the normal population ranging from 8 to 35 repeats. Expansions to over 40 repeats lead to spinal bulbar muscular<lb/> atrophy (SBMA), a late onset neurodegenerative disease. The repeat is located between the two parts of a bipartite amino-terminal<lb/> transactivation function and the repeat length, also within in the normal range, is inversely correlated to the transactivation power<lb/> of the receptor. P160 type co-activators bind more strongly to shorter repeats. A correlation between AR CAG repeat length and<lb/> total risk, age at diagnosis, recurrence after surgery and aggressive growth has been reported for tumors of classical androgen target<lb/> tissues. In the prostate, where androgens exert a mitogenic effect, the cancer risk increases with decreasing AR-CAG repeat length.<lb/> In contrast, in the breast, where the hormone probably acts as anti-mitogen, a higher risk and earlier onset of breast cancer has been<lb/> reported for carriers of BRCA1 mutations who also have long CAG repeats in the receptor gene. Somatic alterations during<lb/> carcinogenesis appear to be frequent in endometrial and in colon cancer. In the endometrium the AR CAG repeat prevalently<lb/> undergoes expansions consistent with the putative protective function of androgens in this tissue. Frequent repeat reductions during<lb/> colon carcinogenesis would be consistent with a mitogenic effect of androgens. Analysis of AR protein expression by Western blot<lb/> reveals expression of the AR in healthy and neoplastic colon tissues. Normal mucosa of the colon expresses both AR-isoforms of<lb/> 110 and 87 kDa, while the tumor samples have lost the expression of the 110-kDa isoform. The 87-kDa isoform is devoid of the<lb/> amino-terminal portion of the receptor molecule that also contains the poly-glutamine tract. The temporal and causal relation<lb/> between isoform switch and somatic repeat reductions during colon carcinogenesis is as yet unclear, but the two events could both<lb/> enhance p160 mediated androgen signaling. The recent finding that smad3 interacts with the AR in a way similar to p160 links the<lb/> AR to TGFb signaling. Interruption of this signaling pathway is a frequent event in colon carcinogenesis. #</div>
