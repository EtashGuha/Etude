	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Trophoblasts lack expression of all classical MHC antigens. Determination of the mechanism involved could provide insight into<lb/> selective gene suppression and allograft tolerance. Suppression of class II expression in trophoblasts is secondary to dominant<lb/> negative trans-acting factors that suppress class II transactivator (CIITA) transcription. We recently described a trophoblast-derived<lb/> noncoding RNA (TncRNA) that suppresses class II expression. Murine B-cells CH27 were stably transfected with TncRNA and<lb/> analyzed for MHC class II and CIITA expression by FACS and Northern blots. Functional assessment of CIITA promoter III<lb/> (pIII) was performed by transient transfection of promoterâ€“reporter constructs. Methylation of pIII was assessed by Southern blots<lb/> and FACS. TncRNA suppressed constitutive I-Ak and CIITA expression in murine B-cells CH27. The mechanism involves inhi-<lb/>bition of CIITA pIII activity. The mechanism does not involve methylation of the promoter.<lb/></div>
