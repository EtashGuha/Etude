		<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT <lb/>In signal analysis-synthesis, the analysis derives a set of parameters that the synthesis uses to reconstruct the original <lb/>signal. In musical applications, this reconstruction should <lb/>be perceptually accurate, and the parameterization should <lb/>allow for such desirable signal modifications as time-scaling, <lb/>pitch-shifting, and cross-synthesis; the analysis parameters <lb/>should correspond to a signal model that is flexible enough <lb/>to allow these transformations. Sinusoidal modeling meets <lb/>this flexibility requirement, but has difficulty representing <lb/>some salient features of musical signals such as attack transients and noiselike processes. In this paper, sinusoidal <lb/>modeling is reviewed and some variations are proposed to <lb/>account for its shortcomings; also, wavelet-based representations of musical signals are considered. <lb/></div>
