	<div type="abstract">Mutations in the NPHS1 gene encoding nephrin lead<lb/> to congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish<lb/> type. Nephrin is a key component of the glomerular<lb/> slit diaphragms between epithelial foot processes, but<lb/> its role in the pathogenesis of this disease is poorly<lb/> understood. To further clarify the molecular mecha-<lb/>nisms involved we investigated the interactions be-<lb/>tween nephrin and other components of the foot<lb/> processes and filtration slits, especially adherens<lb/> junction proteins, and searched for novel nephrin<lb/> interacting proteins. Using co-immunoprecipitation<lb/> and pull-down assays we show here that nephrin<lb/> forms a multiprotein complex with cadherins and<lb/> p120 catenin and with three scaffolding proteins,<lb/> ZO-1, CD2AP, and CASK, in kidney glomeruli and<lb/> when expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.<lb/> CASK was identified as a novel binding partner of<lb/> nephrin by mass spectrometry and was localized to<lb/> podocytes in the glomerulus. CASK is a scaffolding<lb/> protein that participates in maintenance of polarized<lb/> epithelial cell architecture by linking membrane pro-<lb/>teins and signaling molecules to the actin cytoskele-<lb/>ton. Our results support a model whereby the glomer-<lb/>ular slit diaphragms are composed of cell adhesion<lb/> molecules of the immunoglobulin and cadherin su-<lb/>perfamilies that are connected to each other and to<lb/> the actin cytoskeleton and signaling networks via the<lb/> cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins CASK, CD2AP, and<lb/> ZO-1.

	<div type="introduction">A key finding in understanding the molecular mecha-<lb/>nisms involved in the pathogenesis of proteinuria was the<lb/> identification of the NPHS1 gene, which is mutated in the<lb/> congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type.<lb/> 1<lb/> NPHS1 encodes for nephrin,<lb/> 1 a member of the immuno-<lb/>globulin (Ig) superfamily of cell adhesion molecules,<lb/> 2<lb/> which is localized in the glomerular slit diaphragm and<lb/> has been suggested to form the framework of this spe-<lb/>cialized cell adhesion structure.<lb/> 3–5<lb/> Slit diaphragms are important components of the glo-<lb/>merular filtration barrier. They bridge the urinary spaces<lb/> between the foot processes of the glomerular epithelium<lb/> and serve to attach foot processes to one another. They<lb/> are considered to represent specialized cell junctions<lb/> because they are derived from typical junctional com-<lb/>plexes during glomerular development,<lb/> 6 and in nephrotic<lb/> animals the slit diaphragms are replaced by tight junc-<lb/>tions.<lb/> 7,8 In addition to nephrin several other novel pro-<lb/>teins, Neph1<lb/> 9,10 and podocin,<lb/> 11 have been localized to<lb/> the slit diaphragm along with several proteins character-<lb/>istic of tight and adherens junctions including ZO-1 and<lb/> cadherins. ZO-1 is an actin-associated protein and is<lb/> concentrated on the cytoplasmic side of tight junctions in<lb/> polarized epithelial cells.<lb/> 12,13 In the glomerulus it is con-<lb/>centrated on the cytoplasmic side of the slit dia-<lb/>phragm 14,15 and has been suggested to function as a<lb/> scaffolding protein that organizes signaling complexes at<lb/> the slit diaphragm.<lb/> 16 P-cadherin,<lb/> 17,18 a classical cad-<lb/>herin, and FAT,<lb/> 19 a cadherin superfamily member of un-<lb/>known function, have also been localized to the slit dia-<lb/>phragm. Cadherins are key components of adherens<lb/> junctions that mediate Ca<lb/> 2ϩ -dependent, homotypic cell<lb/> adhesion.<lb/> 20,21 Their presence in the slit diaphragm sug-<lb/>gests that the slit diaphragm may have some of the<lb/> properties of a modified adherens junction.<lb/> 17</div>
