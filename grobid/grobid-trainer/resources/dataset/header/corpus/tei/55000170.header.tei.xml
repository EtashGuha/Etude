	<div type="introduction">What is power factor?<lb/> Power factor is the relationship between working<lb/> (active) power and total power consumed (apparent<lb/> power). Essentially, power factor is a measurement of<lb/> how effectively electrical power is being used. A higher<lb/> power factor represents a more effective use of electrical<lb/> power.<lb/> A distribution system&apos;s operating power is composed<lb/> of two parts: Active (working) power and reactive (non-<lb/>working magnetizing) power. The ACTIVE power per-<lb/>forms the useful work â€“ the REACTIVE power does not.<lb/> Reactive power&apos;s only function is to develop magnetic<lb/> fields required by inductive loads.<lb/> Why improve low power factor?<lb/> Low power factor means poor electrical efficiency. The<lb/> lower the power factor, the higher the apparent power<lb/> drawn from the distribution network.<lb/> When low power factor is not corrected, the utility must<lb/> provide the nonworking reactive power in addition to the<lb/> working active power. This results in the use of larger<lb/> generators, transformers, bus bars, wires, and other<lb/> distribution system devices that otherwise would not be<lb/> necessary.<lb/> As the utility&apos;s capital expenditures and operating<lb/> costs are going to be higher, they are going to pass<lb/> these higher expenses to industrial users in the form<lb/> of power factor penalties and higher utility bills.<lb/>
