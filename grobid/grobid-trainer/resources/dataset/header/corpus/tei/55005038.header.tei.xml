			<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> N-vinylcarbazole (NVCz) was evaporated toward a
				substrate of a glass slide coated with silver 100 nm thick with the existence of a
				red-<lb/> heated filament. The processes of vapor deposition polymerization (VDP)
				and annealing were observed with in-situ infrared reflection<lb/> absorption
				spectroscopy. The filament temperature of 2300 K and the substrate temperature of
				266 K were effective to retard the re-evaporation<lb/> of deposited NVCz. After NVCz
				was deposited on the above conditions and then annealed at 285 K, the resulting VDP
				film had a number<lb/> average molecular weight of 1.1 X lo4 and a polymer yield of
				88%.<lb/>
