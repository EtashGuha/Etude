		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We recently introduced a new flow control scheme, called send-time control, which is <lb/>based on a deterministic model of virtual circuits in a computer network. In this scheme, <lb/>the time at which a packet is sent by a source is computed from estimates of round-trip <lb/>time, traffic in the network and bottleneck service time. In this paper, we describe a new <lb/>transport protocol, called DTP, which uses send-time control as its flow control scheme. <lb/>Preliminary measurements of coast-to-coast connections over the Internet show significant <lb/>performance improvement over TCP, which is the most commonly used transport protocol <lb/>in the Internet today. <lb/></div>
