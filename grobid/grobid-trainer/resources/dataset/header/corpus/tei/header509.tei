		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The purpose of these notes is to describe some of the physical and mathematical properties <lb/>of the equations occurring in global illumination. We first examine the physical assumptions <lb/>that make the particle model of light an appropriate paradigm for computer graphics and <lb/>then derive a balance equation for photons. In doing this we establish connections with the <lb/>field of radiative transfer and its more abstract counterpart, transport theory. The resulting <lb/>balance equation, known as the equation of transfer, accounts for large-scale interaction <lb/>of light with participating media as well as complex reflecting surfaces. Under various <lb/>simplifying assumptions the equation of transfer reduces to more conventional equations <lb/>encountered in global illumination. <lb/></div>
