	<div type="abstract">In the mid 1980s, Agilent Technologies developed several products that<lb/> measure the electromagnetic properties of material samples. At that time<lb/> Agilent Technologies was a part of the Hewlett Packard Company. These<lb/> products were developed to meet the needs our customers involved in the<lb/> development of electronic components, circuits and systems. These<lb/> products were also used by Department of Defense contractors involved in<lb/> the design and development of stealth vehicles. Since there introductions<lb/> these products have found many other applications. The aim of this<lb/> presentation is to give a survey of these and other potential applications .</div>
