			<div type="abstract">a b s t r a c t<lb/> Context: Business processes are an important
				source for the engineering of customized software systems<lb/> and are constantly
				gaining attention in the area of software engineering as well as in the area of
				informa-<lb/> tion and system security. While the need to integrate processes and
				role-based access control (RBAC)<lb/> models has been repeatedly identified in
				research and practice, standard process modeling languages<lb/> do not provide
				corresponding language elements.<lb/> Objective: In this paper, we are concerned
				with the definition of an integrated approach for modeling pro-<lb/> cesses and
				process-related RBAC models – including roles, role hierarchies, statically and
				dynamically<lb/> mutual exclusive tasks, as well as binding of duty constraints on
				tasks.<lb/> Method: We specify a formal metamodel for process-related RBAC models.
				Based on this formal model,<lb/> we define a domain-specific extension for a
				standard modeling language.<lb/> Results: Our formal metamodel is generic and can be
				used to extend arbitrary process modeling lan-<lb/> guages. To demonstrate our
				approach, we present a corresponding extension for UML2 activity models.<lb/> The
				name of our extension is Business Activities. Moreover, we implemented a library and
				runtime engine<lb/> that can manage Business Activity runtime models and enforce the
				different policies and constraints in a<lb/> software system.<lb/> Conclusion: The
				definition of process-related RBAC models at the modeling-level is an important
				prere-<lb/> quisite for the thorough implementation and enforcement of corresponding
				policies and constraints in<lb/> a software system. We identified the need for
				modeling support of process-related RBAC models from<lb/> our experience in
				real-world role engineering projects and case studies. The Business Activities
				approach<lb/> presented in this paper is successfully applied in role engineering
				projects.<lb/></div>
