	<div type="introduction">The TEI P4 Guidelines first appeared in print in June 2002. P4 was the first version<lb/> of the Guidelines to implement proper XML support, while ensuring backwards compatibility<lb/> with earlier TEI specifications.<lb/> P4 was superseded by the release of the P5 Guidelines in November 2007. To learn how to<lb/> migrate from P4 to P5, visit the migration page.<lb/>Getting the P4 Guidelines<lb/>Download<lb/> The text of the P4 Guidelines is available online, as HTML or PDF files.<lb/></div>

	The TEI Guidelines are also provided as a modular, extensible, DTD (Document Type<lb/> Definition). The modules making up the TEI DTD can be configured for use either as an<lb/> SGML or an XML DTD. There are full details in the P4 DTD document.<lb/> You can view the DTD files online or download them as a bundled set in the form of a<lb/> compressed tar archive or zip archive, including both HTML and DTD.<lb/>
