		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>According to space-based theory, visual attention is limited to a local region in space <lb/>called the attentional field. Visual information within the attentional field is enhanced <lb/>for further processing while information outside is suppressed. There is evidence that <lb/>enhancement and suppression are achieved with dynamic weighting of network activity. <lb/>This paper discusses a neural network that generates the appropriate weights, called the <lb/>attentional spotlight, given the size and the position of the intended attentional field. <lb/>The network has three layers. A shunting feedback network serves as the output layer <lb/>and performs a critical task which cannot be accomplished by feedforward networks. <lb/></div>
