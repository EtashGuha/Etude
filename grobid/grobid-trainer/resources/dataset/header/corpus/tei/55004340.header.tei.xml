	<div type="abstract">Consumers&apos; attitude towards hygiene and active lifestyle has created a rapidly increasing market for a wide range of<lb/> antimicrobial textiles, which in turn has stimulated intensive research and development. As a result, the number of<lb/> biofunctional textiles with an antimicrobial activity has increased considerably over the last few years. In a near future,<lb/> biomedical products will perhaps be the largest application of antimicrobial textiles since they find applications for<lb/> prevention, as surgical lab coats, or therapy as wound dressings.<lb/> Several antimicrobial agents have been tested in textiles. They have powerful bactericidal activity as indicated by the MIC<lb/> value. However, the majority has a reduced spectrum of microbial inhibition and may cause skin irritation, ecotoxicity and<lb/> bacteria resistance. Moreover, the biocide can gradually lose activity during the use and launderings of the textile. In<lb/> addition, wearing these textiles in a continuous manner can lead to sensitization and bacteria resistance. As a result, and to<lb/> minimize such risks, there is a great demand for antimicrobial textiles based on non-toxic and ecofriendly agents.<lb/> Due to the relatively lower incidence of adverse reactions of natural products in comparison with synthetic<lb/> pharmaceuticals, they can be exploited as an attractive ecofriendly alternative for textile applications.</div>
