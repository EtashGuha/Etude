	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Moments before the launch of every space vehicle, engineering<lb/> discipline specialists must make a critical go/no-go decision. The<lb/> cost of a false positive, allowing a launch in spite of a fault, or a false<lb/> negative, stopping a potentially successful launch, can be measured<lb/> in the tens of millions of dollars, not including the cost in morale and<lb/> other more intangible detriments. The Aerospace Corporation is<lb/> responsible for providing engineering assessments critical to the<lb/> go/no-go decision for every Department of Defense space vehicle.<lb/> These assessments are made by constantly monitoring streaming<lb/> telemetry data in the hours before launch. We will introduce VizTree,<lb/> a novel time-series visualization tool to aid the Aerospace analysts<lb/> who must make these engineering assessments. VizTree was<lb/> developed at the University of California, Riverside and is unique in<lb/> that the same tool is used for mining archival data and monitoring<lb/> incoming live telemetry. The use of a single tool for both aspects of<lb/> the task allows a natural and intuitive transfer of mined knowledge to<lb/> the monitoring task. Our visualization approach works by<lb/> transforming the time series into a symbolic representation, and<lb/> encoding the data in a modified suffix tree in which the frequency<lb/> and other properties of patterns are mapped onto colors and other<lb/> visual properties. We demonstrate the utility of our system by<lb/> comparing it with state-of-the-art batch algorithms on several real<lb/> and synthetic datasets.<lb/></div>
