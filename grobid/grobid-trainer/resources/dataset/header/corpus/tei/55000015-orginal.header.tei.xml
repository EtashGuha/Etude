			<div type="abstract">Abstract We demonstrate the fabrication and testing of a prototype
				microtome knife based on a<lb/> multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) for cutting ∼100
				nm thick slices of frozen–hydrated<lb/> biological samples. A piezoelectric-based 3D
				manipulator was used inside a scanning electron<lb/> microscope (SEM) to select and
				position individual MWCNTs, which were subsequently<lb/> welded in place using
				electron beam-induced deposition. The knife is built on a pair of tungsten<lb/>
				needles with provision to adjust the distance between the needle tips, accommodating
				various<lb/> lengths of MWCNTs. We performed experiments to test the mechanical
				strength of a MWCNT<lb/> in the completed device using an atomic force microscope
				tip. An increasing force was applied<lb/> at the mid-point of the nanotube until
				failure occurred, which was observed in situ in the SEM.<lb/> The maximum breaking
				force was approximately (8 × 10 −7 ) N which corresponds well with<lb/> the typical
				microtome cutting forces reported in the literature. In situ cutting experiments
				were<lb/> performed on a cell biological embedding plastic (epoxy) by pushing it
				against the nanotube.<lb/> Initial experiments show indentation marks on the epoxy
				surface. Quantitative analysis is<lb/> currently limited by the surface asperities,
				which have the same dimensions as the nanotube.<lb/></div>
