		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Reactive systems respond to concurrent, possibly unsynchronized streams of input events. Programming <lb/>reactive systems is challenging without language support for event-triggered actions. It is even more <lb/>challenging to reason about reactive systems. This paper explores a new conceptual basis for applying <lb/>functional programming techniques to the design and formal verification of reactive systems. The <lb/>mathematical foundation for this approach is based upon signature coalgebras and derived proof rules <lb/>for coinduction. The concepts are illustrated with an example that has been used with the language <lb/>Esterel. <lb/></div>
