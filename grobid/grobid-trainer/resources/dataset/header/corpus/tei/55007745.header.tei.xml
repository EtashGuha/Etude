	<div type="abstract">The rates of thiourea oxidation with Fe(VI) were determined<lb/> as a function of pH (8.8-11.5) and temperature (10-35<lb/> °C). The rate law for the oxidation of thiourea was found<lb/> to be -d[Fe(VI)]/dt ) k 0 {[H + ]/[H + ]+K 9 )}[Fe(VI)][thiourea]<lb/> where k 0 ) 5.9 × 10 4 M -1 s -1 , pK 9 ) 7.8. The activation<lb/> energy, ∆E * , obtained was 32.2 ( 1.8 kJ mol -1 . The rate<lb/> constant for the reaction of Fe(VI) with the thiourea radical<lb/> was determined by using a premix pulse radiolysis<lb/> technique and was found to be 8.5 × 10 8 M -1 s -1 at pH<lb/> ) 9.0. The stoichiometric ratio of Fe(VI) and thiourea was<lb/> found to be 1:0.38 ( 0.02 at pH ) 9.0. Sulfate and urea<lb/> were identified as the products of the reaction. Tests were<lb/> conducted on the oxidative destruction of thiourea by Fe-<lb/>(VI) in synthetic boiler chemical cleaning wastes (BCCW)<lb/> and are discussed.<lb/></div>
