	<div type="abstract">A file format is a particular way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file.<lb/> Since a disk drive, or indeed any computer storage, can store only bits, the computer must have some way of<lb/> converting information to 0s and 1s and vice-versa. There are different kinds of formats for different kinds of<lb/> information. Within any format type, e.g., word processor documents, there will typically be several different<lb/> formats. Sometimes these formats compete with each other.<lb/> File formats are divided into proprietary and open formats.<lb/></div>
