	<div type="abstract">It is becoming increasingly clear that panels of analytes ooer greater<lb/> promise for enabling diagnostics with improved sensitivity, speciicity<lb/> and ultimately clinical utility. Diiractive optics technology incorporated<lb/> in the dotLabÂ® System allows not only for the inter-feature multiplexing<lb/> with an extended dynamic range, but also for intra-feature multiplexing.<lb/> By sequentially probing captured analytes for interacting proteins<lb/> and/or subunits as well as with aanity reagents speciic for<lb/> post-translational modiications, one can transform cumbersome assays<lb/> into simple and very informative assays. We report two speciic<lb/> examples of intra-feature multiplexing assays.<lb/> 1. Detection of the cardiac Troponin complex in patients&apos; samples:<lb/> In the heart, cTnI is part of the troponin (Tn) complex comprising<lb/> troponin I (cTnI), troponin T(cTnT) and troponin C (TnC) which is<lb/> released into the blood upon cardiac muscle necrosis and cell death. It<lb/> has been previously demonstrated that a subcomplex of cTnI-cTnC<lb/> circulates in the blood. Furthermore, cTnI has been shown to speciically<lb/> and selectively degrade with increasing severity of AMI. Until now, the<lb/> technology for direct detection of the cTnI primary sequence integrity<lb/> and the ternary form of circulating cTnI has been lacking. The question<lb/> remains whether circulating cTnI is degraded or is bound to cTnC and/or<lb/> TnT and whether these various circulating forms of cTnI correlate to long<lb/> term patient outcomes. We have developed a sensitive and<lb/> simple-to-use method to directly characterize the interactions between<lb/> cTnI, cTnT and cTnC from clinical samples as well as probe the integrity<lb/> of cTnI.<lb/> 2. Seroconversion in Strongyloides stercoralis infected individuals<lb/> Infected individuals are typically asymptomatic. However, when<lb/> immunocompromised, the infection can rapidly progress to a<lb/> hyperinfected and disseminated state, with an associated mortality of<lb/> approximately 80%. We have developed a rapid serological method of<lb/> determining Strongyloides infection. The method utilizes a recombinant<lb/> antigen to capture antibodies from 10 uL of serum. Sequential probing<lb/> of positive patients samples with isotype speciic antibodies (IgG1,2,3,4<lb/> and IgE) enabled the determination of antibody isotype prooles in a<lb/> single assay. This assay successfully detected serum Strongyloides<lb/> antibodies in less than 30 minutes and showed little cross reactivity to<lb/> sera from healthy individuals or patients with other parasitic infections.<lb/> Isotype prooles may improve serodiagnosis and provide information on<lb/> disease status such as chronicity or drug resistance.</div>
