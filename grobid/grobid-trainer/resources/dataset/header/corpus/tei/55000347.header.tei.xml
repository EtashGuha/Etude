	<div type="abstract">The peculiar nature of electron scattering in graphene is among many exciting theoretical predictions<lb/> for the physical properties of this material. To investigate electron scattering properties in a graphene<lb/> plane, we have created a gate-tunable potential barrier within a single-layer graphene sheet. We report<lb/> measurements of electrical transport across this structure as the tunable barrier potential is swept through a<lb/> range of heights. When the barrier is sufficiently strong to form a bipolar junction (n-p-n or p-n-p) within<lb/> the graphene sheet, the resistance across the barrier sharply increases. We compare these results to<lb/> predictions for both diffusive and ballistic transport, as the barrier rises on a length scale comparable to the<lb/> mean free path. Finally, we show how a magnetic field modifies transport across the barrier.<lb/></div>

	<div type="introduction">The recent discovery by Novoselov et al. [1] of a new<lb/> two-dimensional carbon material —graphene —has trig-<lb/>gered an intense research effort [2 – 4]. Carriers in gra-<lb/>phene have two unusual characteristics: they exist on two<lb/> equivalent but separate sublattices, and they have a nearly<lb/> linear dispersion relation. Together these ingredients<lb/> should give rise to remarkable transport properties includ-<lb/>ing an unusual suppression of backscattering [5]. Unlike in<lb/> conventional metals and semiconductors, electrons in gra-<lb/>phene normally incident on a potential barrier should be<lb/> perfectly transmitted, by analogy to the Klein paradox of<lb/> relativistic quantum mechanics [6 –8]. Backscattering<lb/> would require either breaking of the &apos;&apos;pseudospin&apos;&apos; sym-<lb/>metry between electrons living on the two atomic sublat-<lb/>tices of the graphene sheet [8] or a momentum transfer of<lb/> order of the Fermi wave vector k F , which can only be<lb/> produced by a sharp, atomic-scale step in the potential.<lb/> In addition to the obvious relevance to future graphene-<lb/>based electronics, understanding transport across potential<lb/> barriers in graphene is essential for explaining transport in<lb/> graphene close to zero average density, where local poten-<lb/>tial fluctuations produce puddles of n-and p-type carriers<lb/> [9]. We report an experiment in which a tunable potential<lb/> barrier has been fabricated in graphene, and we present<lb/> measurements of the resistance across the barrier as a<lb/> function of the barrier height and the bulk carrier density.<lb/> To create a tunable potential barrier in graphene, we<lb/> implemented a design with two electrostatic gates, a global<lb/> back gate and a local top gate [Fig. 1(a)]. A voltage V b<lb/> applied to the back gate tunes the carrier density in the bulk<lb/> of the graphene sheet, whereas a voltage V t applied to the<lb/> top gate tunes the density only in the narrow strip below the<lb/> gate. These gates define two areas in the graphene sheet<lb/> whose densities n 2 —underneath the top gate —and n 1 —<lb/> everywhere else—can be controlled independently<lb/> [Fig. 1(b)]. The graphene was deposited by successive<lb/> mechanical exfoliation of natural graphite crystals using<lb/> an adhesive tape (Nitto Denko Corp.) [1]. After exfoliation,<lb/> thin graphite flakes were transferred onto a chip with<lb/> 280 nm thermal oxide on top of an n   Si substrate,<lb/> used as the back gate. A single-layer graphene sheet was<lb/> identified using an optical microscope, and 30 nm thick<lb/> Ti=Au leads were evaporated onto the sheet using standard<lb/> e-beam lithography. To form the dielectric layer for the top<lb/> gate, a thin layer of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA<lb/> molecular mass 950 K, 2% in anisole) was then spun<lb/> onto the Si chip at 4000 rpm for 35 s and baked at<lb/> 180 C for 2 min. On one section of the graphene sheet,<lb/> the PMMA was cross-linked by exposure to 30 keV elec-<lb/>trons at a dose of 21 000 C cm ÿ2 [10]. The unexposed<lb/> PMMA was removed by soaking the chip for 10 min in<lb/> acetone. Finally, a 50 nm thick, 300 nm wide Ti=Au strip<lb/> was deposited on top of the cross-linked PMMA using<lb/> standard e-beam lithography to form the top gate<lb/> [Fig. 1(c)]. Raman spectroscopy of the sheet indicates<lb/> that it is in fact composed of a single layer [11–13].</div>
