		<div type="abstract">Abstract| Common security models such as Bell-LaPadula <lb/>focus on the control of access to sensitive data but leave <lb/>some important systems issues unspecified, such as the implementation of read-only objects, garbage collection, and <lb/>object upgrade and downgrade paths. Consequently, different implementations of the same security model may have <lb/>conflicting operational and security semantics. We propose <lb/>the use of more expressive security labels for specifying these <lb/>system issues within the security model, so that the semantics of a system design are precisely understood and are <lb/>independent of implementation details. <lb/></div>
