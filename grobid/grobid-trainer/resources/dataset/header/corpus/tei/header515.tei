		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing tries to select a path that satisfies a set of <lb/>QoS constraints, while also achieving overall network resource efficiency. We <lb/>present initial results on QoS path selection for traffic requiring bandwidth <lb/>and delay guarantees. For traffic with bandwidth guarantees, we found that <lb/>several routing algorithms that favor paths with fewer hops perform well. For <lb/>traffic with delay guarantees, we show that for a broad class of WFQ-like <lb/>scheduling algorithms, the problem of finding a path satisfying bandwidth, <lb/>delay, delay-jitter, and/or buffer space constraints while at the same time <lb/>deriving the bandwidth that has to be reserved to meet these constraints, is <lb/>solvable by a modified version of the Bellman-Ford shortest-path algorithm <lb/>in polynomial time. <lb/></div>
