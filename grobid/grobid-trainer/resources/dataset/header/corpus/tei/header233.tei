		<div type="abstract">Abstract. Domain or background knowledge is often needed in order <lb/>to solve difficult problems of learning medical diagnostic rules. Earlier <lb/>experiments have demonstrated the utility of background knowledge <lb/>when learning rules for early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases. A particular form of background knowledge comprising typical co-occurrences <lb/>of several groups of attributes was provided by a medical expert. This <lb/>paper explores the possibility to automate the process of acquiring background knowledge of this kind. A method based on function decomposition is proposed that identifies typical co-occurrences for a given set <lb/>of attributes. The method is evaluated by comparing the typical co-occurrences it identifies, as well as their contribution to the performance <lb/>of machine learning algorithms, to the ones provided by a medical expert. <lb/></div>
