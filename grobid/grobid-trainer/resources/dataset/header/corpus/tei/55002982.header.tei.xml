	<div type="abstract">Abstract: Eleven statewide waste characterization studies were compared to assess variation in the quantity and composition of waste<lb/> after separation of recyclable and compostable materials, i.e., discarded waste. These data were also used to assess the impact of varying<lb/> composition on sequestered carbon and methane yield. Inconsistencies in the designation of waste component categories and definitions<lb/> were the primary differences between study methodologies; however, sampling methodologies were consistent with recommended<lb/> protocols. The average municipal solid waste ͑MSW͒ discard rate based on the statewide studies was 1.90 kg MSW person<lb/> −1 day<lb/> −1 ,<lb/> which was within the range of two national estimates: 2.35 and 1.46 kg MSW person<lb/> −1 day<lb/> −1 . Dominant components in MSW discards<lb/> were similar between studies. Organics ͑food waste, yard trimmings͒, paper, and plastic components averaged 23.6Ϯ 4.9%, 28.5Ϯ 6.5%,<lb/> and 10.6Ϯ 3.0% of discarded MSW, respectively. Construction and demolition ͑C&amp;D͒ waste was 20.2Ϯ 9.7% of total solid waste discards<lb/> ͑i.e., MSW plus C&amp;D͒. Based on average statewide waste composition data, a carbon sequestration factor ͑CSF͒ for MSW of 0.13 kg C<lb/> dry kg MSW<lb/> −1 was calculated. For C&amp;D waste, a CSF of 0.14 kg C dry kg C and D waste<lb/> −1 was estimated. Ultimate methane yields ͑L o ͒<lb/> of 59.1 and 63.9 m<lb/> 3 CH 4 wet Mg refuse<lb/> −1 were computed using EPA and state characterization study data, respectively, and were lower<lb/> than AP-42 guidelines. Recycling, combustion, and other management practices at the local level could significantly impact CSF and ͑L o ͒<lb/> estimates, which are sensitive to the relative fraction of organic components in discarded MSW and C&amp;D waste.<lb/></div>
