	<div type="abstract">Title RUNX1 mutated cases in acute myeloid leukemia share a distinct biological<lb/> subgroup and are associated with inferior outcome. Results of the AML Study<lb/> Group (AMLSG).<lb/> Organism Homo sapiens<lb/> Experiment type Expression profiling by array<lb/> Summary PURPOSE: To evaluate frequency, biological features and clinical relevance of<lb/> RUNX1 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).<lb/> PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnostic samples from 945 patients (18 to 60<lb/> years) were analyzed for RUNX1 mutations. In a subset of cases (n=269)<lb/> microarray gene expression analysis was performed.<lb/> RESULTS: Fifty-nine RUNX1 mutations were identified in 53 of 945 (5.6%)<lb/> cases, predominantly in exons 3 (n=11), 4 (n=10) and 8 (n=23). RUNX1<lb/> mutations clustered in the intermediate-risk cytogenetic group (46/640, 7.2%;<lb/> cytogenetically normal, 34/538, 6.3%), they were less frequent in adverse-risk<lb/> cytogenetics (5/109, 4.6%), and absent in core-binding-factor AML (0/77) and<lb/> acute promyelocytic leukemia (0/61); RUNX1 mutations were associated with<lb/> MLL-partial tandem duplications (p=0.0007) and IDH1/IDH2 mutations<lb/> (p=0.03), inversely correlated with NPM1 (p&lt;0.0001) and in trend with CEBPA<lb/> (p=0.10) mutations. RUNX1 mutations were characterized by a distinct gene<lb/> expression pattern; this RUNX1 mutation-derived signature was not exclusive<lb/> for the mutation, but also included mostly adverse-risk AML [eg, 7q-, -7, inv(3)<lb/> or t(3;3)]. RUNX1 mutations predicted for resistance to chemotherapy (rates of<lb/> refractory disease 30% and 19%, p=0.047, for RUNX1-mutated and wildtype<lb/> patients, respectively), as well as inferior event-free survival (EFS; p&lt;0.0001),<lb/> relapse-free survival (RFS, p=0.022), and overall survival (p=0.051). In<lb/> multivariable analysis, RUNX1 mutations were an independent prognostic<lb/> marker for shorter EFS (p=0.007). Explorative subgroup analysis revealed that<lb/> allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had a favorable impact on<lb/> RFS in RUNX1-mutated patients (p&lt;0.0001).<lb/> CONCLUSION: AML with RUNX1 mutations exhibit distinct biological properties<lb/> and are associated with resistance to therapy and inferior outcome.<lb/> Overall design<lb/> A total of 269 RNA samples derived from adult AML patients were provided by<lb/> the German Austrian AML Study Group (AMLSG) [AMLSG trial AML HD98A<lb/> (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00146120)].<lb/> Conventional cytogenetic banding, and FLT3, CEBPA and NPM1 mutational<lb/> analysis were performed as previously described (Schlenk et al., N Engl J Med<lb/> 2008). Detailed clinical, cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic information are<lb/> also provided in the supplementary information.<lb/> Following enrichment, all samples contained at least 80% leukemic cells. Gene<lb/> expression profiling (GEP) was performed as previously described (Bullinger et<lb/> al., N Engl J Med 2004).<lb/></div>
