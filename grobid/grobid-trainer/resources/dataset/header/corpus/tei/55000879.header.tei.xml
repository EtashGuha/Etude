	<titlePart>A Survey of Methods Using Balanced Photodetection<lb/></titlePart>
	</docTitle>

	<div type="introduction">Balanced photodetection is a commonly used detection<lb/> method in the lab when an experiment requires increased<lb/> signal-to-noise. This detection method has many<lb/> advantages to simply amplifying a signal with an amplifier<lb/> following the photodiode. In some cases, it can also<lb/> achieve better noise performance and sensitivity than an<lb/> avalanche photodiode (APD). It is particularly powerful in<lb/> its ability to cancel laser noise or &quot;common mode noise&quot;<lb/> and in its ability to detect small signal fluctuations on a<lb/> large DC signal. In this application note we explore a wide<lb/> variety of detection methods utilizing balanced<lb/> photodetectors and briefly discuss their implementation.<lb/> The most simple case of balanced detection is realized<lb/> when two photodiodes are connected such that their<lb/> photocurrents cancel. In this case, it is necessary to<lb/> equalize the DC optical power impinging upon each<lb/> photodiode by using a variable neutral density filter, for<lb/> example. When this is done, the effective output of the<lb/> balanced pair of photodiodes is zero until there is some<lb/> difference in the intensity of one of the beams. When this<lb/> occurs, it causes the pair to become &quot;unbalanced&quot; and a net<lb/> signal appears on the output.<lb/> To avoid the often tedious, manual task of balancing the<lb/> intensities of the two beams, an auto-balancing circuit can<lb/> be employed which was originally developed by Hobbs at<lb/> IBM</div>
