		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Web caches can not only reduce network traffic and <lb/>downloading latency, but can also affect the distribution of web traffic over the network through cost-aware caching. This paper introduces GreedyDual-Size, which incorporates locality with cost and size <lb/>concerns in a simple and non-parameterized fashion <lb/>for high performance. Trace-driven simulations show <lb/>that with the appropriate cost definition, GreedyDual-Size outperforms existing web cache replacement algorithms in many aspects, including hit ratios, latency reduction and network cost reduction. In addition, GreedyDual-Size can potentially improve the <lb/>performance of main-memory caching of Web documents. <lb/></div>
