	<div type="abstract">Chromosomal painting is a technique for the microscopic localization of genetic material. It has been<lb/> applied at the subcellular level to identify regions of eukaryotic chromosomes. Here we describe the develop-<lb/>ment of bacterial chromosomal painting (BCP), a related technology for the identification of bacterial cells.<lb/> Purified genomic DNAs from six bacterial strains were labeled by nick translation with the fluorochrome<lb/> Fluor-X, Cy3, or Cy5. The average size of the labeled fragments was ca. 50 to 200 bp. The probes were<lb/> hybridized to formaldehyde-fixed microbial cells attached to slides and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.<lb/> In reciprocal comparisons, distantly related members of the class Proteobacteria (Escherichia coli and Oceano-<lb/>spirillum linum), different species of the genus Bacillus (B. subtilis and B. megaterium), and different serotypes<lb/> of the subspecies Salmonella choleraesuis subsp. choleraesuis (serotype typhimurium LT2 and serotype typhi<lb/> Ty2) could easily be distinguished. A combination of two probes, each labeled with a different fluorochrome,<lb/> was used successfully to simultaneously identify two cell types in a mixture. Lysozyme treatment was required<lb/> for the identification of Bacillus spp., and RNase digestion and pepsin digestion were found to enhance signal<lb/> strength and specificity for all cell types tested. Chromosome in situ suppression, a technique that removes<lb/> cross-hybridizing fragments from the probe, was necessary for the differentiation of the Salmonella serotypes<lb/> but was not required to distinguish the more distantly related taxa. BCP may have applications in diverse<lb/> branches of microbiology where the objective is the identification of bacterial cells.<lb/></div>
