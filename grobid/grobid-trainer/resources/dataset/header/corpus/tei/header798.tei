		<div type="abstract">Abstract. We present a technique to study relations between weak and <lb/>strong fi-normalisations in various typed -calculi. We first introduce a <lb/>translation which translates a -term into a I-term, and show that a <lb/>-term is strongly fi-normalisable if and only if its translation is weakly <lb/>fi-normalisable. We then prove that the translation preserves typability <lb/>of -terms in various typed -calculi. This enables us to establish the <lb/>equivalence between weak and strong fi-normalisations in these typed <lb/>-calculi. This translation can deal with Curry typing as well as Church <lb/>typing, strengthening some recent closely related results. This may bring <lb/>some insights into answering whether weak and strong fi-normalisations <lb/>in all pure type systems are equivalent. <lb/></div>
