	<div type="introduction"> ode junction, thereby closing the switch in the anode-to-cath-<lb/>ode or forward direction. The SCR differs in operation from<lb/> the three-layer bipolar junction transistor (BJT) in latching<lb/> after gating and the buildup of sufficient latching current. The<lb/> SCR stays latched on until its anode-to-cathode current (gate<lb/> open) is reduced below a holding current limit. The thyristor<lb/> also differs from the transistor in displaying bistable action<lb/> that depends on pnpn regenerative feedback.<lb/> A thyristor can be unidirectional or bidirectional, have<lb/> from two to six leads (Fig. 1), and be triggered from a voltage<lb/> blocking state to a conducting state by gate current; by light<lb/> (photon) energy (e.g., from a laser); by a voltage change<lb/> dv/dt, as in the reverse-switching rectrifier (RSR); or by two-<lb/>terminal breakover, as in the diac and the Shockley diode).<lb/> The triac and silicon bilateral switches are examples of bidi-<lb/>rectional thyristors that conduct current in either direction.<lb/> A unique property of the thyristor is regeneration, herein<lb/> defined as simultaneous electron and hole injection from the<lb/> cathode and anode emitters respectively. The SCR gate cur-<lb/>rent acts to initiate electron injection from the cathode emit-<lb/>ter. After electrons transit the narrow p base, they enter the<lb/> wide n-base and initiate hole injection from the anode emit-<lb/>ter, thereby resulting in charge neutrality, regeneration, and<lb/> latch-on. Anode current delay results from the time required<lb/> for electrons to transit the thin p-base, which can be reduced<lb/> by (dual) gating the cathode and anode emitters simultane-<lb/>ously.<lb/> Reverse-switched dynistors (RSDs, from the I. V. Grek-<lb/>hov–A. F. Ioffe Institute, Russia) are two-terminal thyristors<lb/> with shorted anode emitters. Dynistors are designed to turn<lb/> on by passing reverse current from cathode to anode, thereby<lb/> modulating the central junction prior to the first current zero<lb/> crossing. Dual gating from both anode and cathode emitters<lb/> can be achieved by optical, dv/dt, or dual gate triggering and<lb/> can result in high di/dt capability.<lb/> The history of pnpn thyristors can be traced back to the<lb/> invention by Schockley, in the early 1950s of the Hook collec-<lb/>tor transistor, now called the Shockley diode. Moll et al. of<lb/> Bell Labs published an article on pnpn transistor switches in<lb/> 1956 (1). In the late 1950s R. A. York, aware of the Bell Labs<lb/> work, initiated a commercial effort at the General Electric<lb/> (GE) Company that would eventually result in the first wide-<lb/>THYRISTOR TYPES<lb/> A thyristor is a semiconductor switch consisting of four alter-<lb/>nately doped pnpn layers. Thyristors are typically available<lb/> to control voltage and current from ȁ100 V to 10,000 V and<lb/> from 1 A to Ͼ3000 A (rms), and vary in size from Ͻ5 mm to<lb/> Ͼ125 mm chip diameter. The most common thyristor is the<lb/> semiconductor-controlled rectifier (SCR). The SCR is a three-<lb/>terminal thyristor device with anode, cathode, and gate termi-<lb/>nals. Thyristors are also available within integrated circuits<lb/> (ICs), particularly in telecom applications.<lb/>
