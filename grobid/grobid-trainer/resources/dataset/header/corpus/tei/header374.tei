		<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT <lb/>Air Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) of the future will feature Free Flight, in which aircraft choose <lb/>their own routes, altitude, and speed, and automated conflict resolution methods in which aircraft <lb/>will coordinate to resolve conflicts. The resulting distributed control architecture is a hybrid system, with <lb/>mixed discrete event and continuous time dynamics. <lb/>SmartATMS is an object oriented modeling and simulation facility which accounts for these hybrid issues <lb/>and will serve as a uniform modeling framework for <lb/>the design and evaluation of various ATMS concepts. <lb/></div>
