	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT:<lb/> A strategy for building extraction and building reconstruction from dense LIDAR data is presented. Roofs are modeled as plane<lb/> surfaces, connected along ridges and bordered by the eaves lines. Initial segmentation of terrain and non-terrain features is<lb/> performed on grid data; after segmentation by region growing and region topology, classification is achieved based on a hierarchical<lb/> set of aggregation rules. Areas labelled as potential buildings are further segmented in plane surfaces (roofs slopes) based on<lb/> gradient orientation and plane fitting by RANSAC; a similar procedure applies to edge pixels to extract eaves lines. The topology of<lb/> the roof slopes and walls is reconstructed, deriving also roof ridges and roof corners. A 3D model of the building is thereafter<lb/> obtained which can be imported in CAD and visualization environments, such as those provided by the VTP group. Results from a<lb/> laser scanning survey with a ground resolution of 1 m are presented for a suburban area in Pavia.<lb/></div>
