	<div type="introduction">Three new galloyl arbutins, hyemalosides A-C (1-3), along with nine known compounds were isolated from the<lb/> evergreen tree Eugenia hyemalis. The structures of compounds 1-3 were determined by analysis of NMR and MS<lb/> data. Compounds 1-3 inhibited HIV-1 RNase H in Vitro with IC 50 values of 1.46, &gt;18, and 1.19 µM, respectively.<lb/> However, in a XTT-based cell viability assay using the human T-cell line CEM-SS infected with HIV-1 RT , none of the<lb/> compounds inhibited the cytopathic effect of HIV-1 infection at the highest dose tested (20 µg/mL).<lb/> As part of a molecularly targeted screening program to discover<lb/> drug leads from natural products, we investigated the chemistry of<lb/> the evergreen tree Eugenia hyemalis L. Cambess (Myrtaceae). The<lb/> organic extract of the plant showed inhibition of ribonuclease H<lb/> (RNase H) enzymatic activity in a high-throughput screening assay.<lb/> 1<lb/> RNase H is a second, distinct enzymatic activity of the HIV-1<lb/> reverse transcriptase protein. It is a nonspecific nuclease that is<lb/> responsible for hydrolyzing the RNA strand of a RNA/DNA<lb/> heteroduplex and allowing the incorporation of viral genetic<lb/> information into the host cell genome. Because RNase H activity<lb/> is required for viral infectivity, it is a viable target for screening<lb/> for potential anti-HIV drugs, and a high-throughput fluorescence<lb/> resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay<lb/> 1 was developed for this<lb/> purpose.<lb/> Bioassay-guided fractionation of the extract led to the isolation<lb/> of three new compounds, hyemalosides A-C (1-3), along with<lb/> nine known compounds. The structures of the nine known<lb/> compounds were determined on the basis of spectroscopic evidence<lb/> and comparison with literature values. These were characterized<lb/> as 2-O-galloylarbutin,<lb/> 2 4-O-galloylarbutin, 2,6-di-O-galloylarbutin,<lb/> 3</div>
