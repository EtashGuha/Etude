		<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT <lb/>A stochastically based approach for the semantic analysis component of a natural spoken language system for the ATIS task has been <lb/>developed. The semantic analyzer of the spoken language system <lb/>already in use at LIMSI makes use of a rule-based case grammar. In <lb/>this work, the system of rules for the semantic analysis is replaced <lb/>with a relatively simple, first order Hidden Markov Model. The <lb/>performance of the two approaches can be compared because they <lb/>use identical semantic representations despite their rather different <lb/>methods for meaning extraction. We use an evaluation methodology <lb/>that assesses performance at different semantic levels, including the <lb/>database response comparison used in the ARPA ATIS paradigm. <lb/></div>
