	<div type="abstract">The cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15-deoxy-⌬<lb/> 12,14 -PGJ 2 (15d-PGJ 2 ) has been shown to display protective effects against renal<lb/> injury or inflammation. In cultured mesangial cells (MC), 15d-PGJ 2 inhibits the expression of proinflammatory genes and<lb/> modulates cell proliferation. Therefore, cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPG) have been envisaged as a promise in the<lb/> treatment of renal disease. The effects of 15d-PGJ 2 may be dependent on or independent from its role as a peroxisome<lb/> proliferator–activated receptor agonist. It was shown recently that an important determinant for the peroxisome proliferator–<lb/> activated receptor–independent effects of 15d-PGJ 2 is the capacity to modify proteins covalently and alter their function.<lb/> However, a limited number of protein targets have been identified to date. Herein is shown that a biotinylated derivative of<lb/> 15d-PGJ 2 recapitulates the effects of 15d-PGJ 2 on the stress response and inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase levels<lb/> and forms stable adducts with proteins in intact MC. Biotinylated 15d-PGJ 2 was then used to identify proteins that potentially<lb/> are involved in cyPG biologic effects. Extracts from biotinylated 15d-PGJ 2 –treated MC were separated by two-dimensional<lb/> electrophoresis, and the spots of interest were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Identified targets include proteins that are<lb/> regulated by oxidative stress, such as heat-shock protein 90 and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, as well as proteins that are<lb/> involved in cytoskeletal organization, such as actin, tubulin, vimentin, and tropomyosin. Biotinylated 15d-PGJ 2 binding to<lb/> several targets was confirmed by avidin pull-down. Consistent with these findings, 15d-PGJ 2 induced early reorganization of<lb/> vimentin and tubulin in MC. The cyclopentenone moiety and the presence of cysteine were important for vimentin<lb/> rearrangement. These studies may contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of action and therapeutic potential of<lb/> cyPG.<lb/></div>

	<div type="introduction">P<lb/> rostaglandins with cyclopentenone structure are en-<lb/>dogenous eicosanoids that are generated by nonenzy-<lb/>matic dehydration of arachidonic acid metabolites. Cy-<lb/>clopentenone prostaglandins (cyPG) exert varied biologic<lb/> actions, including inhibition of cell proliferation in several can-<lb/>cer cell lines and anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities. The<lb/> molecular basis for these varied effects is multiple. The com-<lb/>mon feature of these prostaglandins is the presence of an un-<lb/>saturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentane ring (cyclopen-<lb/>tenone; see Figure 1). This structure was found early to be an<lb/> important requirement for the antitumoral and antiviral effects<lb/> of cyPG (1). This moiety confers cyPG the capacity to form<lb/> covalent adducts with thiol groups in glutathione or in proteins<lb/> by Michael addition (Figure 1). Modification of critical cysteine<lb/> residues in signaling proteins can modulate cell function. More-<lb/>over, some cyPG, such as 15-deoxy-⌬<lb/> 12,14 -PGJ 2 (15d-PGJ 2 ), may<lb/> act as ligands for the transcription factors of the nuclear recep-<lb/>tor superfamily known as peroxisome proliferator–activated<lb/> receptors (PPAR), which have been reported to play important<lb/> roles in the regulation of lipid metabolism (2) and in cardio-<lb/>vascular and renal pathophysiology (3,4). For these reasons, the<lb/> potential use of cyPG as therapeutic agents has been explored<lb/> in numerous studies using cellular and animal models of in-<lb/>flammation or injury. Protective effects of micromolar concen-<lb/>trations of 15d-PGJ 2 against ischemia-reperfusion injury and<lb/> multiple-organ failure caused by endotoxic shock have been<lb/> reported (5–7). These beneficial effects were associated with an<lb/> inhibition of the inflammatory response and of the activation of<lb/> transcription factors NF-␬B and activator protein 1 (AP-1). An-<lb/>ti-inflammatory effects of 15d-PGJ 2 have also been evidenced in<lb/> cultured cells. In mesangial cells (MC), 15d-PGJ 2 inhibited cy-<lb/>tokine-elicited induction of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (8) and mono-<lb/>cyte chemoattractant protein-1 (9). By using an analog of 15d-<lb/>PGJ 2 that retains full PPAR agonist activity but lacks the<lb/> cyclopentenone structure, we showed recently that the capacity<lb/> of 15d-PGJ 2 to modify covalently cellular thiols plays a key role<lb/> in the inhibition of proinflammatory genes such as inducible<lb/> nitric oxide (iNOS), cyclo-oxygenase-2, and ICAM-1 in MC (10).<lb/> Several proteins that are involved in the activation of NF-␬B<lb/> and AP-1, as well as components of the transcription factors<lb/> themselves, have been identified as targets for modification by<lb/> 15d-PGJ 2 . Modification of IKK reduces NF-␬B activation<lb/> (11,12), whereas 15d-PGJ 2 addition to critical cysteines in the</div>
