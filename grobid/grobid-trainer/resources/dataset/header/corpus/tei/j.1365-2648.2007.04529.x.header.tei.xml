	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Title. Chinese couples' experiences during convalescence from a first heart attack: a<lb/> focus group study<lb/> Aim. This paper is a report of a study to explore Chinese patients' and partners'<lb/> experiences during early convalescence from a first heart attack.<lb/> Background. There are important socio-cultural differences between Chinese and<lb/> western populations and comparatively little is known about the experiences of<lb/> Chinese patients and partners living with a first heart attack.<lb/> Method. A qualitative study using focus groups was conducted in 2005 with 17<lb/> Chinese patients and their partners during convalescence from a first heart attack.<lb/> The interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed. Analysis was used to identify<lb/> categories using established qualitative phenomenological techniques.<lb/> Findings. Content analysis of the data revealed five major categories: enduring<lb/> uncertainty; coping with changes; experiencing emotional reactions; living with<lb/> medications and needing professional help.<lb/> Conclusion. The experiences of Chinese patients and partners during early conva-<lb/> lescence from a first heart attack are different from their western counterparts and<lb/> are affected by cultural traditions. Findings from this study may provide useful<lb/> pointers for health professionals to deliver culturally sensitive and appropriate<lb/> support and education during early convalescence.<lb/></div>
