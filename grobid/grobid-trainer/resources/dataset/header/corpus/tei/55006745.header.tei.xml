	<div type="abstract">Improved diagnostic reagents are needed for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections, and the<lb/> development of a serodiagnostic test would complement presently available diagnostic methods. The aim of the<lb/> present study was to identify novel serological targets for use for the future serodiagnosis of tuberculosis (TB).<lb/> We cloned and expressed 35 M. tuberculosis proteins as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and analyzed<lb/> their serodiagnostic potentials. By a two-step selection process, four superior seroantigens, TB9.7, TB15.3,<lb/> TB16.3, and TB51, were identified, none of which has been described before. The four novel antigens were<lb/> tested with panels of sera from smear-positive and smear-negative TB patients from areas both where TB is<lb/> endemic and where TB is not endemic, with recognition frequencies ranging from 31 to 93% and with a<lb/> specificity of at least 97%. The single most potent antigen was TB16.3, which had a sensitivity of 48 to 55% with<lb/> samples from Danish resident TB patients and a sensitivity of 88 to 98% with samples from African TB<lb/> patients. Importantly, the TB16.3 and the TB9.7 antigens were recognized by more than 85% of the samples<lb/> from TB patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus, a patient group for which it is in general<lb/> difficult to detect M. tuberculosis-specific antibodies.<lb/></div>
