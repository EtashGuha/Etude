	<div type="abstract">Keyboards and numeric keypads often provide the user interface for electronic equipment, but many applications<lb/> require only a few pushbuttons. For those applications, you can monitor multiple pushbuttons over a single pair of<lb/> wires (Figure 1).<lb/> The multichannel 1-Wire addressable switch, IC 1 , provides PIO (input/output ports) P0 through P7, which in this<lb/> application serve as inputs. The 1-MΩ RPD resistors connect these ports to ground to ensure a defined logic-zero<lb/> state. Diode/capacitor combination D1/ C1 forms a local power supply that steals energy from the 1-Wire<lb/> communication line. Pressing a pushbutton connects the corresponding port to the local supply voltage, which is<lb/> equivalent to logic one. This change of state sets the port&apos;s activity latch (Reference 1).<lb/> As a 1-Wire slave device, IC1 doesn&apos;t initiate communications. Instead, the master device—typically, a<lb/> microcontroller—polls the 1-Wire line. To minimize overhead, IC1 supports conditional search, a 1-Wire network<lb/> function. Before using that function, however, you must configure IC 1 according to the needs of the application. That<lb/> configuration includes channel selection, which defines the qualifying input ports; channel-polarity selection, which<lb/> specifies the polarity of the qualifying ports; choosing a pin or an activity latch for the port; and specifying whether<lb/> the device will respond to activity at a single port, an OR, or at all ports, an AND.<lb/> Consider, for example, that IC1 shall respond to a conditional search if it detects activity at any of the eight ports.<lb/> This search requires a channel-selection mask of 11111111b for address 008Bh. The numeral one indicates that<lb/> IC 1 has selected a port. This search also requires a channel-polarity selection of 11111111b for address 008Ch,<lb/> where the numeral one indicates a high level, and a control/ status register setting of 00000001b for address<lb/> 008Dh, which selects the port&apos;s activity latch as a source and specifies OR as the conditional search term—that is,<lb/> activity at any port.</div>
