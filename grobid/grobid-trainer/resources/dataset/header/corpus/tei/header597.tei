		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>When a moldable job is submitted to a space-sharing <lb/>parallel computer, it must choose whether to begin execution on a small, available cluster or wait in queue for <lb/>more processors to become available. To make this decision, it must predict how long it will have to wait for <lb/>the larger cluster. We propose statistical techniques for <lb/>predicting these queue times, and develop an allocation <lb/>strategy that uses these predictions. We present a workload model based on observed workloads at the San Diego <lb/>Supercomputer Center and the Cornell Theory Center, <lb/>and use this model to drive simulations of various allocation strategies. We find that prediction-based allocation <lb/>not only improves the turnaround time of individual jobs; <lb/>it also improves the utilization of the system as a whole. <lb/></div>
