	<div type="abstract">124 kDa phytochrome has been isolated from etiolated oat seedlings. Specific chemical modifi-<lb/>cation of SH-groups has been performed using several agents, especially mercurials. These proce-<lb/>dures allowed covalent fluorescence labelling of phytochrome. Bleaching of the tetrapyrrole<lb/> chromophore and reduced photoreversibility has been investigated and analyzed in terms of steric<lb/> effects, i.e. size of the reagents and number of modified residues. The Pr form was found to<lb/> exhibit two highly reactive SH-groups, the Pfr form three, however. Two highly reactive groups<lb/> have been localized on the 55 kDa C-terminal half of the protein. The 3rd group predominantly<lb/> reacting in the Pfr form has been localized on a 39 kDa chromopeptide, i.e. on the N-terminal<lb/> half. The covalently attached fluoresceine chromophores were used as reporter groups. The envi-<lb/>ronment of the fluoresceine chromophore is more hydrophobic in the Pfr form than in the Pr<lb/> form, indicating that conformational changes take place during photoconversion.<lb/></div>
