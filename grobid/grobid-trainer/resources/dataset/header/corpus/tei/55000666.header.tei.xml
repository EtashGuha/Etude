That means that you currently can only use it<lb/> from Google Chrome™. However, extensions for other browsers are on their<lb/> way, so you may want to follow the blog or twitter to get the updates.<lb/> What does it do?<lb/> The desktop app is only a bridge between Everytime and your VLC media<lb/> player. Everytime can ask VLC to start, open a specific file, go to such frame,<lb/> capture an image and so on.<lb/> So, once you have it running, all you will see is Everytime&apos;s icon in your</div>
