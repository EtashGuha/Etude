	<div type="abstract">Abstract. A modified system of SI units is described that includes a new category of &quot;physiological units&quot;. In<lb/> this system, physiological units are a special class of derived units that are defined with respect to specified<lb/> reference stimuli for the purpose of calibrating the nominal human response to external physical effects. This<lb/> new category includes the unit of luminous intensity, the candela, and the unit of dose equivalent, the sievert.<lb/> By comparison with the current SI, in the modified SI the candela is classified as a physiological derived unit<lb/> instead of as a base unit and the definition of the sievert is revised to include specification of the reference<lb/> radiation.<lb/></div>
