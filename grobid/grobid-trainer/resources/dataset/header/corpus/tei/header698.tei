		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Most case-based reasoning systems have used a <lb/>single &quot;best&quot; or &quot;most similar&quot; case as the basis <lb/>for a solution. For many problems, however, <lb/>there is no single exact solution. Rather, there <lb/>is a range of acceptable answers. We use cases <lb/>not only as a basis for a solution, but also to <lb/>indicate the boundaries within which a solution <lb/>can be found. We solve problems by choosing <lb/>some point within those boundaries. <lb/>In this paper, I discuss this use of cases with <lb/>illustrations from chiron, a system I have implemented in the domain of personal income <lb/>tax planning. <lb/></div>
