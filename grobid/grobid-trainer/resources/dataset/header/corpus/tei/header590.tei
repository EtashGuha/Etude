		<div type="abstract">Abstract| Generalized connectors provide the capability to connect a single input to one or more outputs. Such networks play an important role in supporting any application that involves the distribution of information from one source to many destinations or many sources to many destinations. We present the first analytic model for evaluating blocking probability in generalized connectors. The model allows flexibility in specifying traffic fanout characteristics and network routing algorithms. Equations are derived for computing blocking probability for the important class of series-parallel networks. We investigate the accuracy of the equations by comparing the blocking probability computed using the equations to results from simulation. <lb/></div>
