	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/>
		Background: Achieving control of hypertension prevents target organ damage at both the micro <lb/>
		and macrovascular level and is a highly cost effective means of lowering the risk for heart attack <lb/>
		and stroke particularly in people with diabetes. Clinical trials demonstrate that blood pressure <lb/>
		control can be achieved in a large proportion of people. Translating this knowledge into widespread <lb/>
		practice is the focus of the Hypertension Management Initiative, which began in 2004 with the goal <lb/>
		of improving the management of this chronic health condition by primary care providers and <lb/>
		patients in the community.<lb/>
		
		Methods: This study will test the effect of a systems change on the management of high blood <lb/>
		pressure in real world practice in primary care in Ontario, Canada. The systems change <lb/>
		intervention involves an interprofessional educational program bringing together physicians, nurses <lb/>
		and pharmacists with tools for both providers and patients to facilitate blood pressure <lb/>
		management. Each of two waves of subjects were enrolled over a 6 month period with the initial <lb/>
		enrollment between waves separated by 9 months. Blood pressure will be measured with the <lb/>
		BpTru ® automated blood pressure device. To determine the effectiveness of the intervention, a <lb/>
		before and after analysis within all subjects will compare blood pressure at baseline to annual <lb/>
		measurements for the three year study. To assess whether the intervention has an impact on blood <lb/>
		pressure control independent of community trends, a betwen group comparison of baseline blood <lb/>
		pressures in the delayed wave will be made with the immediate wave during the same time period, <lb/>
		so that the immediate wave has experienced the intervention for at least 9 months. The total <lb/>
		enrollment goal is 5,000 subjects. The practice locations include 10 Family Health Teams (FHTs) <lb/>
		and 1 Community Health Centre (CHC) and approximately 49 primary care physicians, 15 nurse <lb/>
		practitioners, 37 registered nurses and over 150 community pharmacists across the 11 <lb/>
		communities throughout the province of Ontario. The 11 primary care sites will be divided into <lb/>
		immediate and delayed groups based on geography and the use of an electronic versus a traditional <lb/>
		chart patient record.<lb/>

		Discussion: Initial consideration was given to randomizing the groups, however, for a number of <lb/>
		reasons, this was deemed to not be possible. In order to ensure that the sites in the immediate <lb/>
		intervention and delayed intervention groups are not different from each other, the sites will be <lb/>
		assigned to the intervention groups manually to ensure a distribution of the variables as evenly as <lb/>
		possible.
		
		Given that HSFO approached this particular group of health care providers to participate in a <lb/>
		program relating to hypertension, this may have heightened their awareness of the issue and <lb/>
		affected their management of patients with hypertension. Thus, data will be collected to allow an <lb/>
		assessment of previous practice patterns and determine any impact of the Hawthorne Effect.<lb/>
