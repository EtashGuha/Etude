	<div type="introduction">Results from ongoing studies around the world – England,	Switzerland,<lb/> Australia, Russia, Canada, Belgium, Italy, USA, Sweden	and publications such<lb/> as Experimental Biology and Medicine, Journal of Nutritional &amp; Environmental<lb/> Medicine, Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine, European Conference in<lb/> Equine Nutrition, Compendium of Continuuing Education, Pferdeheilkunde,<lb/> Animal Science, British Journal of Nutrition and the Canadian Journal of<lb/> Veterinary Research –	have collectively elucidated how omega 3 fatty acids<lb/> alter biochemical and molecular processes. The data shows consistent and<lb/> reproducible beneficial effects for man and animals of omega-3 fatty acids on<lb/> bone metabolism, bone/joint diseases, gene expression, immuno-competence<lb/> and disease resistance. Omega 3 fatty acids have a central role in the<lb/> maintenance of a healthy body and in the management and prevention of many<lb/> &apos;modern&apos; disease states.<lb/> Omega 3 oils modulate cell wall flexibility, immune function, inflammatory<lb/> responses and are a potent source of anti-oxidants. Clinical investigations in<lb/> man and animals have demonstrated a reduction in cholesterol, clotting<lb/> abnormalities and blood pressure when Omega 3 oils are returned to the diet.<lb/> Other studies highlight the importance of Omega 3 fatty acids in reducing pain<lb/> and inflammation in patients with degenerative joint disease, rheumatoid<lb/> arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout and spondyloarthritis.<lb/> Importantly for the racing thoroughbred, Omega 3 oils have been shown to<lb/> have an important role in the structure and formation of the wall of the red blood<lb/> cells – conferring upon them increased suppleness and flexibility. This red cell<lb/> flexibility is advantageous during exercise -the more flexible the red blood cells<lb/> the more easily and efficiently they pass through the narrow capillaries in the<lb/> lungs and muscles, making oxygen uptake and delivery and waste product<lb/> removal, more efficient. Human athletes on Omega 3 supplemented diets,<lb/> report improved performance times and less delayed muscle soreness and this<lb/> is attributed to better oxygen delivery, higher levels of anti-oxidants and the<lb/> protective effect omega 3 oils have against inflammation.</div>
