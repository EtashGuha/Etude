			<div type="abstract"> a b s t r a c t<lb/> Polypropylene (PP) composites reinforced
				using a novel plant fiber, sunflower hull sanding dust (SHSD),<lb/> were prepared
				using a twin-screw extruder. Thermal and mechanical properties of the SHSD/PP
				compos-<lb/> ites were characterized and compared to an organically modified clay
				(organo-clay)/PP composite. Differ-<lb/> ential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis
				showed that the crystallization temperature and the degree of<lb/> crystallinity of
				PP exhibited changes with addition of SHSD and organo-clay. Mechanical properties of
				the<lb/> PP were enhanced with the addition of SHSDs. Both the flexural strength and
				flexural modulus of the PP<lb/> composites containing 5% (w/w) SHSD were comparable
				to that of the 5% (w/w) organo-clay reinforced<lb/> PP. Scanning electron microscope
				(SEM) observation showed that no obvious agglomeration of SHSD<lb/> existed in the
				PP matrix. Compared to the neat PP and organo-clay/PP, the SHSD/PP composites
				exhibited<lb/> a relatively decreasing rate of thermal degradation with increase in
				temperature. Experimental results<lb/> suggest that SHSD, as a sunflower processing
				byproduct, may find promising applications in composite<lb/> materials.<lb/>
