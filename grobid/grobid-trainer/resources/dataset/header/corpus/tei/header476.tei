		<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT <lb/>A new virtual memory architecture for the Sun implementation of the UNIX <lb/>operating system is described. Our goals included unifying and simplifying the concepts <lb/>the system used to manage memory, as well as providing an implementation that fit well <lb/>with the rest of the system. We discuss an architecture suitable for environments that <lb/>(potentially) consist of systems of heterogeneous hardware and software architectures. <lb/>The result is a page-based system in which the fundamental notion is that of mapping <lb/>process addresses to files. <lb/></div>
