		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper describes how a runtime support library can be used as compiler runtime <lb/>support in irregular applications. The CHAOS runtime support library carries out <lb/>optimizations designed to reduce communication costs by performing software caching, <lb/>communication coalescing and inspector/executor preprocessing. CHAOS also supplies <lb/>special purpose routines to support specific types of irregular reduction and runtime <lb/>support for partitioning data and work between processors. A number of adaptive <lb/>irregular codes have been parallelized using the CHAOS library and performance results <lb/>from these codes are also presented in this paper. <lb/></div>
