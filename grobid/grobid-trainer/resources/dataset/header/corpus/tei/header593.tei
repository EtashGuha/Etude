		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Association rules, introduced by Agrawal, Imielinski, and <lb/>Swami, are rules of the form &quot;for 90 % of the rows of the <lb/>relation, if the row has value 1 in the columns in set W , <lb/>then it has 1 also in column B&quot;. Efficient methods exist for <lb/>discovering association rules from large collections of data. <lb/>The number of discovered rules can, however, be so large <lb/>that browsing the rule set and finding interesting rules from <lb/>it can be quite difficult for the user. We show how a simple <lb/>formalism of rule templates makes it possible to easily describe the structure of interesting rules. We also give examples of visualization of rules, and show how a visualization <lb/>tool interfaces with rule templates. <lb/></div>
