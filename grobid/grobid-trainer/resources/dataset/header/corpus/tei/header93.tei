		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>It is argued that the following three properties are foundations of robust robot <lb/>navigation: <lb/>* The use of landmarks (and, in particular, the use of a compass sense), <lb/>* the use of canonical paths, and <lb/>* the use of topological rather than geometrical maps. <lb/>Some examples of successful animal navigation are presented that support this view. <lb/>We have performed initial experiments with mobile robots to investigate mechanisms <lb/>suitable to implement such navigational architectures. Experiments concerning navigation by dead reckoning are presented, and a differential light compass is introduced <lb/>to aid robot navigation. <lb/></div>
