		<div type="abstract">In this paper, we present an approach for the reconstruction of teeth model. Therefore, <lb/>a tooth model has to be scanned from several directions with a 3D-laser scanner. Several <lb/>views are necessary because of shadows and occluded areas in the range images. Then, <lb/>all acquired range views are combined to build a CAD-model of the tooth. The idea is <lb/>that every part of the surface should be visible in at least one view. The reconstruction <lb/>process is divided into the steps registration, volume sculpturing and generation of an <lb/>accurate polygonal representation. <lb/></div>
