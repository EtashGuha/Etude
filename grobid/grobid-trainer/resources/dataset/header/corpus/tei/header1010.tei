		<div type="abstract">Abstract.  The recent notion of the perfect fluid created at the Relativistic Heavy<lb/> Ion Collider (RHIC) has been embraced by many experimentalists and theorists alike.<lb/> However much of the evidence to this notion has been based on the success of describing<lb/> some experimental observables by non-viscous hydrodynamics or by small shear<lb/> viscosity to entropy density ratio. Developments on viscous hydrodynamics evolved<lb/> from (0+1) dimensions (Bjorken scaling solution) over (1+1) dimensions (Bjorken + <lb/> transverse flow) to (2+1) dimensions (Elliptic flow) and currently (3+1) dimensions.<lb/> There still exists some formal issues concerning the allowed form of the relativistic<lb/> viscous hydrodynamic equations and what effects the new additional or higher-order<lb/> terms will have on the space-time evolution and the experimental observables. Starting<lb/> with a brief introduction of the basics of relativsitic fluid dynamics, I will discuss our<lb/> current knowledge of relativistic theory of fluid dynamics in the presence of dissipative<lb/> fluxes.<lb/></div>
