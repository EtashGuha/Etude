		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper presents a method that can be used for <lb/>the elicitation and specification of requirements and <lb/>high-level design. It supports stakeholder-based modeling, rapid feasibility feedback to marketing, and the <lb/>interpersonal dynamics that are necessary to develop <lb/>a product. The method centers on the role of the facilitator, an independent agent whose purpose is to build <lb/>the Integrated System Model (ISM). The ISM is the result of merging the independent system views from all <lb/>stakeholders at any given abstraction level. Formulation of this method was based on the real-world experience of developing a complex, high-technology medical <lb/>product with critical time-to-market pressures. It has <lb/>proven to be a practical approach to the evolution of <lb/>requirements definition and provides a necessary link <lb/>to the marketing aspect of a product. <lb/></div>
