	<div type="abstract">AbstractÐThe problem of optimally placing data on disks (ODP) to maximize<lb/> disk-access performance has long been recognized as important. Solutions to this<lb/> problem have been reported for some widely available disk technologies, such as<lb/> magnetic CAV and optical CLV disks. However, important new technologies such<lb/> as multizoned magnetic disks, have been recently introduced. For such<lb/> technologies no formal solution to the ODP problem has been reported. In this<lb/> paper, we first identify the fundamental characteristics of disk-device technologies<lb/> which influence the solution to the ODP problem. We develop a comprehensive<lb/> solution to the problem that covers all currently available disk technologies. We<lb/> show how our comprehensive solution can be reduced to the solutions for existing<lb/> disk technologies, contributing thus a solution to the ODP problem for multizoned<lb/> disks. Our analytical solution has been validated through simulations and through<lb/> its reduction to the known solutions for particular disks. Finally, we study how the<lb/> solution for multizoned disks is affected by the disk and data characteristics.<lb/></div>
