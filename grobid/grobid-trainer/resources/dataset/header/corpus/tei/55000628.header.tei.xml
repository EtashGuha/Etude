	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Precision ranging radios are a critical aid to integrated<lb/> locating, tracking, navigation, and guidance systems,<lb/> especially when GPS service is degraded or unavailable<lb/> [5]. In this work, a high-precision, software-defined,<lb/> round-trip time-of-flight, direct sequence spread spectrum<lb/> (DSSS) ranging radio operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band<lb/> is presented. This system builds upon our previous<lb/> brassboard implementation at 915 MHz [1, 2], and<lb/> continues ENSCO&apos;s decade-long research in this area [6,<lb/> 7] with system enhancements bringing the performance<lb/> closer to the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for round-trip<lb/> DSSS time-of-flight ranging.<lb/> The system is capable of performing 217 independent<lb/> range measurements per second with measurement<lb/> standard deviation as low as 2.5 cm in a benign line-of-<lb/>sight RF environment. The system achieves high distance<lb/> linearity and low intercept offset using a single-point<lb/> calibration method. The ranging performance has been<lb/> characterized at distances in excess of 1 kilometer and in<lb/> indoor line-of-sight situations.<lb/></div>
