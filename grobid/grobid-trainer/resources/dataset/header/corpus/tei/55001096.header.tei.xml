	<div type="abstract">DESIGN OUR PRODUCTS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT<lb/>As part of the our move to Mozilla and thinking about a free-as-in-speech Enso, I<lb/> want to be more transparent with our design directions and goals. Our designs can<lb/> only benefit by incorporating the criticism and suggestions of the community we<lb/> have here. Open-source design is a balancing act between making final decisions<lb/> and finding consensus. We hope to take the lessons that Jono spelled out in his<lb/> excellent article on successfully humane open-source projects and use them in<lb/> our own projects.<lb/> This post is about the new directions we are taking Enso. If you haven&apos;t done so<lb/> yet, start by reading about some of the motivations for doing some Enso redesign.<lb/> In short:<lb/> Enso shouldn&apos;t make you type all of &quot;open&quot; every time<lb/> Enso should be able to open paths and urls<lb/> Enso should support international character input<lb/> Enso should gracefully handle the case where there&apos;s no convenient place to<lb/> enter text<lb/> Enso shouldn&apos;t require you to type out text, select it, and then run a command<lb/> when you&apos;d rather run the command and then enter the text (think calculate)<lb/> Enso shouldn&apos;t make you hold down a key while typing lots of characters<lb/> We think we&apos;ve solved these problems with our Enso 2.0 redesign. In this post, and<lb/> possible follow on posts, I&apos;ll walk through the new stuff. I should note that our<lb/> upcoming prototype will not yet have have all of the features mentioned here.<lb/> </div>
	
	<div type="introduction">Autocomplete<lb/> One of the major design challenges in Enso is balancing between descriptive<lb/> names and short names. This is not a new problem: Unix command lines used short<lb/> names instead of descriptive names. That&apos;s why Unix ended up with such<lb/> memorable commands as &quot;df&quot; and &quot;tar -xvzf&quot;. For Enso, the problem is particularly<lb/> noticeable for commands that that have similar beginnings. For example, the &quot;translate to&quot; family of commands makes my fingers unhappy. I have to type out all<lb/> of &quot;translate to&quot; before choosing a language. Why? Because &quot;translate from&quot; is<lb/> alphabetically before &quot;translate to&quot;, so that&apos;s what gets autotyped when I hit tab.</div>
