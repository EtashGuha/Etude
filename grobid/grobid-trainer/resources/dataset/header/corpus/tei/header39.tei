		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>A digraph D is called a quasi-transitive digraph (QTD) if for any <lb/>triple x; ; of distinct vertices of D such that (x; ) and (; ) are <lb/>arcs of D there is at least one arc from x to or from to x. Solving <lb/>a conjecture by J. Bang-Jensen and J. Huang (J. Graph Theory, to <lb/>appear), G. Gutin (Australas. J. Combin., to appear) described polynomial algorithms for finding a Hamiltonian cycle and a Hamiltonian <lb/>path (if it exists) in a QTD. The approach taken in that paper cannot <lb/>be used to find a longest path or cycle in polynomial time. We present <lb/>a principally new approach that leads to polynomial algorithms for <lb/>finding vertex heaviest paths and cycles in QTD&apos;s with non-negative <lb/>weights on the vertices. This, in particular, provides an answer to a <lb/>question by N. Alon on longest paths and cycles in QTD&apos;s. <lb/></div>
