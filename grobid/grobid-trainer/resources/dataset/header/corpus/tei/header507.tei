		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Mitchell defined and axiomatized a subtyping relationship (also known <lb/>as containment, coercibility, or subsumption) over the types of System F <lb/>(with &quot;!&quot; and &quot;8&quot;). This subtyping relationship is quite simple and does <lb/>not involve bounded quantification. Tiuryn and Urzyczyn quite recently <lb/>proved this subtyping relationship to be undecidable. This paper supplies a new undecidability proof for this subtyping relationship. First, a <lb/>new syntax-directed axiomatization of the subtyping relationship is defined. Then, this axiomatization is used to prove a reduction from the <lb/>undecidable problem of semi-unification to subtyping. The undecidability of subtyping implies the undecidability of type checking for System F <lb/>extended with Mitchell&apos;s subtyping, also known as &quot;F plus eta&quot;. <lb/></div>
