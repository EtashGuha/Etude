	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Using the currently available products and protocols to screen a large number of<lb/> samples expressing recombinant proteins is a very time consuming and tedious<lb/> process. We demonstrate an expression screening system that addresses this problem<lb/> by providing a simple and fast method suitable for high throughput use.<lb/> Maltose binding protein-mIL2 fusion protein (MBP-mIL2), *thioredoxin-DEADbox<lb/> (TDB) fusion protein and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed in E.coli; GFP<lb/> and CDK4 proteins expressed in Sf21 insect cells; and Î²-galactosidase expressed in<lb/> Pichia were screened using this system. In 30 minutes, the soluble and insoluble frac-<lb/>tions from these expression cultures were obtained.<lb/> The system is capable of extracting proteins from very high density cultures without<lb/> clogging the filter. This is useful in situations where low protein expression is<lb/> observed. We have demonstrated extraction of MBP-mIL2 fusion protein from con-<lb/>centrated E.coli cell culture with an OD600 of up to 15.<lb/></div>
