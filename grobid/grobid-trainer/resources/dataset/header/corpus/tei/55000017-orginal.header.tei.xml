			<div type="abstract">Abstract: Rearranged during transfection, RET, is a receptor
				tyrosine kinase expressed in neural crest derived cell lineages. RET is<lb/>
				activated by dimerisation facilitated by its binding to the heterodimeric complex
				formed by Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor<lb/> (GDNF) -family ligand (GFL)
				and GNDF-family receptor (GFR). Both GDNFs and their co-receptors are a small
				protein family of four<lb/> members. RET kinase mediated signaling can lead to
				survival, cell growth, differentiation, and migration. Pharmaceutically RET is
				of<lb/> interest due to its involvement in several disease conditions. Oncogenic RET
				activation by mutations or rearragements predisposes to<lb/> cancers like multiple
				endocrine neoplasia type 2 (A and B) and medullary thyroid carcinoma.
				Loss-of-function mutations in RET are a<lb/> strong susceptibility factor for
				Hirschsprung disease, which is characterized by lack of ganglion cells in
				gastrointestinal tract. All the<lb/> GFLs promote neuronal survival and GDNF is one
				of the most potent neurotrophic factors for dopaminergic neurons. Therefore,
				the<lb/> neuroprotective capacity of RET activation to override the apoptotic
				program in neurodegenerative diseases, like in dying midbrain<lb/> dopaminergic
				neurons in Parkinson's disease, is of great interest. This article reviews the
				recent international patents on modulation of<lb/> RET kinase activity by
				small-molecule and peptide-based agonists and antagonists.<lb/></div>
