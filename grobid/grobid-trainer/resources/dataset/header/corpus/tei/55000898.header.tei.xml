	<div type="abstract">An Escheyichia coli rRNA probe was compared with a combination of 0 serotyping, phage susceptibility, and<lb/> biotype pattern for the type identification of strains of Enterobacter cloacae. Forty-five isolates of E. cloacae<lb/> from 36 patients in nine hospitals were examined. By conventional typing, only 26 (57.7%) could be assigned<lb/> to a specific serotype and 6 (13.3%) were autoagglutinating owing to rough lipopolysaccharide antigens. All<lb/> isolates could be assigned to one of three biotypes, but many phage sensitivity patterns were evident. Twenty-<lb/>nine distinct strains were identified by combined typing. Probing of EcoRI and BamHI digests of chromosomal<lb/> DNA with a cDNA copy of E. coli rRNA proved to be highly discriminating between strains. Thirty different<lb/> ribotypes based on 28 bands were recorded. Overall, agreement between the ribotyping and combined typing<lb/> methods was good (84.4%), and discrepancies were generally confined to serologically unclassifiable strains and<lb/> variability in biotype codes. Ribotyping was reproducible, and five of six pairs of isolates from the same and<lb/> different patients gave identical hybridization profiles on separate occasions. We conclude tht4 ribotyping is a<lb/> highly discriminatory and reproducible method for the typing of E. cloacae, but in most outbreaks it offers little<lb/> increase in discrimination over traditional methods.</div>
	
<div type="introduction"><lb/> In recent years Enterobacter cloacae has emerged as a<lb/> significant nosocomial pathogen, and outbreaks of infection<lb/> in surgical wards and intensive care units have been de-<lb/>scribed (2, 11). The organism is a normal member of the<lb/> gastrointestinal flora. It is relatively susceptible to antibiot-<lb/>ics but is invariably resistant to ampicillin and first-genera-<lb/>tion cephalosporins. Resistance often develops to newer<lb/> enzyme-stable beta-lactam antibiotics (18).<lb/> Many typing systems have been described to aid epidemi-<lb/>ological studies of E. cloacae, including serological, phage,<lb/> bacteriocin, and biotype systems (5). None of these methods<lb/> is satisfactory when used alone for the typing of E. cloacae<lb/> due either to inadequate discrimination, poor reproducibil-<lb/>ity, or low typability. When used in combination they allow<lb/> reasonably accurate identification of strain types, but owing<lb/> to their complexity, they are not generally available outside<lb/> reference centers.<lb/> Grimont and Grimont (7) proposed the use of patterns of<lb/> genes encoding rRNA localized by hybridization with radio-<lb/>actively labeled Escherichia coli rRNA to identify the gen-<lb/>otype of strains. This approach has been used successfully to<lb/> detect these genes in various bacterial species (hence the<lb/> name ribotyping [21]) for both taxonomic and epidemiolog-<lb/>ical purposes (9, 13). As an alternative to the radioactive end<lb/> labeling of rRNA (7), a DNA strand complementary to the<lb/> RNA sequence can be prepared to facilitate uniform labeling<lb/> with biotin (15). The genotype obtained is independent of<lb/> phenotypic and cultural variation, and differences in hybrid-<lb/>ization profiles are considered representative of species<lb/> and/or strains.<lb/> We have compared ribotyping of E. cloacae with standard<lb/> reference techniques in a variety of outbreak situations.
