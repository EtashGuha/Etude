		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We present a new method for accelerating walkthroughs of geometrically complex static <lb/>scenes. As a preprocessing step, our method constructs a BSP-tree that hierarchically partitions the geometric primitives in the scene. In the course of a walkthrough, images of nodes <lb/>at various levels of the hierarchy are cached for reuse in subsequent frames. A cached image is applied as a texture map to a single quadrilateral that is drawn instead of the geometry <lb/>contained in the corresponding node. Visual artifacts are kept under control by using an error metric that quantifies the discrepancy between the appearance of the geometry contained <lb/>in a node and the cached image. The new method is shown to achieve significant speedups <lb/>for a walkthrough of a complex outdoor scene, with little or no loss in rendering quality. <lb/></div>
