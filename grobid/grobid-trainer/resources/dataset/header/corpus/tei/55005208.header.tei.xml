	<div type="introduction">I Since most MC tools are WIN32-based, hard<lb/> real-time requirements cannot be fulfilled. But<lb/> soft real-time systems that only require a typi-<lb/>cal latency time and an upper limit of timeout<lb/> incidents per unit time can use this mechanism.<lb/> CANape Graph implemented this feature such<lb/> that mean latency times of about 0.7 millisec-<lb/>onds can be achieved with greater than 99.99%<lb/> reliability on modern PC hardware platforms<lb/> with 10 ms cycle time. Compared to a hardware-<lb/>based solution, bypassing based on XCP STIM<lb/> is very inexpensive and only requires compo-<lb/>nents that are already available in the ECU de-<lb/>velopment and calibration environments.<lb/> Bypassing parts of the firmware code of an<lb/> ECU (electronic control unit) is a useful mech-<lb/>anism in developing control algorithms in the<lb/> area of automotive development. Since the al-<lb/>gorithm can be developed and tested using<lb/> modelling tools, the development cycle time<lb/> can be reduced. One of the major problems was<lb/> the time delay between input data retrieval and<lb/> output data availability in the ECU when ex-<lb/>plicit UPLOAD and DOWNLOAD commands<lb/> of the XCP protocol are used, because these<lb/> commands require the response of the ECU.<lb/> XCP (a standard automotive calibration proto-<lb/>col defined by the ASAM organization) intro-</div>
