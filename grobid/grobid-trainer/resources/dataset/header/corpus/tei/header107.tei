		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Maya is a simulation platform for evaluating the performance of parallel programs on parallel architectures with different memory coherence protocols. Rapid prototyping of different memory protocols <lb/>supporting varying degrees of coherence is possible and the impact of these protocols on the performance <lb/>of application programs can be studied. Implementations of existing weak memories along with some <lb/>new primitives using Maya are presented. The results of running some user applications are summarized <lb/>and the impact of weak memories on the efficiency of parallel programs is discussed. <lb/></div>
