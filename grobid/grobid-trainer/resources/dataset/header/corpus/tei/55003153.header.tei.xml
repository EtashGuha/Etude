	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> BACKGROUND: Conventional biodiesel production relies on trans-esterification of lipids extracted from vegetable crops.<lb/> However, the use of valuable vegetable food stocks as raw material for biodiesel production makes it an unfeasibly expensive<lb/> process. Used cooking oil is a finite resource and requires extra downstream processing, which affects the amount of biodiesel<lb/> that can be produced and the economics of the process. Lipids extracted from microalgae are considered an alternative<lb/> raw material for biodiesel production. This is primarily due to the fast growth rate of these species in a simple aquaculture<lb/> environment. However, the dilute nature of microalgae culture puts a huge economic burden on the dewatering process<lb/> especially on an industrial scale. This current study explores the performance and economic viability of chemical flocculation<lb/> and tangential flow filtration (TFF) for the dewatering of Tetraselmis suecica microalgae culture.<lb/> RESULT: Results show that TFF concentrates the microalgae feedstock up to 148 times by consuming 2.06 kWh m −3 of energy<lb/> while flocculation consumes 14.81 kWh m −3 to concentrate the microalgae up to 357 times. Economic evaluation demonstrates<lb/> that even though TFF has higher initial capital investment than polymer flocculation, the payback period for TFF at the upper<lb/> extreme of microalgae revenue is ∼1.5 years while that of flocculation is ∼3 years.<lb/> CONCLUSION: These results illustrate that improved dewatering levels can be achieved more economically by employing TFF.<lb/> The performances of these two techniques are also compared with other dewatering techniques.<lb/></div>
