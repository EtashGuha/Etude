		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>It has previously been shown that there exists a minimum degree ordering for regular grids that is considerably worse than nested dissection <lb/>in terms of fill-in and operations for factorization [1]. This paper proves <lb/>the existence of a minimum degree ordering for regular grids that has the <lb/>same optimal asymptotic order complexity for fill-in and operation count <lb/>as nested dissection. The analysis is verified by showing exact match between analytical prediction and experimental measurement. The analysis <lb/>motivates a peripheral preordering strategy for use with the popular multiple minimum degree (MMD) algorithm, and is shown to consistently <lb/>reduce fill-in and operation count for regular grids. <lb/></div>
