	<div type="abstract">Silicon carbide ͑SiC͒ nanorods and microcrystals were synthesized with controlled structure through<lb/> a two-step reaction scheme. Carbon nanotubes ͑CNTs͒ were first grown by the thermal<lb/> decomposition of C 2 H 2 over a Fe/Co metal catalyst loaded on a Si͑100͒ wafer surface. The grown<lb/> CNTs were then reacted with tetramethylsilane ͑TMS͒ to form ␤-SiC nanorods or microcrystals. SiC<lb/> nanorods were observed when CNTs reacted with TMS at 1100 °C in an IR-induced heating<lb/> chemical vapor deposition ͑CVD͒ reactor, whereas SiC microcrystals were formed at 1250 °C in an<lb/> rf-induced-heating CVD reactor. Higher temperature and longer time were favorable for the growth<lb/> of good quality SiC crystals. The blueshift of the PL spectra was observed from the SiC nanorods<lb/> and SiC microcrystals. The structural change of CNTs in the growth was discussed in this work.<lb/></div>
