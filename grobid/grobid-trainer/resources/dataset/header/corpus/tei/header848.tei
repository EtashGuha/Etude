		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In order for a virtual environment to be effective as a training tool, it is not enough to <lb/>concentrate on the fidelity of the renderings and the accuracy of the simulated behaviors. <lb/>The environment should help trainees develop an understanding of the task being trained, <lb/>and should provide guidance and assistance as needed. This paper describes a system for <lb/>developing virtual environments in which pedagogical capabilities are incorporated into <lb/>autonomous agents that interact with trainees. These pedagogical agents can monitor <lb/>trainees progress and provide guidance and assistance. The agents interact with <lb/>simulations of objects in the environment, and with trainees. The paper describes the <lb/>architectural features of the environment and of the agents that permit the agents to meet <lb/>instructional objectives within the virtual environment. It also discusses how agent-based <lb/>instruction is combined with other methods of delivering instruction. <lb/></div>
