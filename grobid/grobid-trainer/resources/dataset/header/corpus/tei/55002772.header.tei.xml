	<div type="introduction">The controlled fermentation should satisfy the sensuous requirements of the consumer, but also<lb/> enriches the products with substances which are unavoidable for man. Therefore at lactic acid<lb/> fermentation it is necessary to watch products content especially of lactic, acetic, as well as other<lb/> organic acids, essential and total amino acids, vitamins from B-group. The formed lactic acid offers<lb/> an agreeably sour taste to products, improves the durability, shortens the time necessary for thermal<lb/> treatment and contributes to colouring stability of the products [l, 21. The vegetables are valuable<lb/> also regarding their fibrous material content, but can contain large amounts of nitrates and<lb/> so are source of nitrates in human nutrition. Importance of fermented vegetables beverages shows<lb/> also the fact, that at fermentation content of nitrates decreases approximately by about 10% in<lb/> comparison with initial amount [3].<lb/> In this paper there is presented the production of organic acids at lactic acid fermentation of celeriac<lb/> and capsicum, in some samples als4 with addition of phytoncide substance.<lb/> Materials and methods<lb/> Fermentation ofceleriac. In the experiments stored celeriac was used which was cut to small cubes<lb/> and covered with brine 3 : 4 (celeriac: brine) before fermentation. In celeriac better anaerobic conditions<lb/> were insured using nitrogen bubbling. Samples C1 -C10 had 1.5% NaCl in brine, but the brine of<lb/> samples C1 and C2 contained also 0.1% potassium sorbate; C3-C5 contained also 0.1% potassium<lb/> sorbate and for these samples nitrogen bubbling was made; C6 -C8 contained also phytoncide substance<lb/> in higher concentration and C9 and C10 contained phytoncide substance in lower concentration.<lb/> Fermentation o j capsicum. The samples were prepared from frozen capsicum fruits. The de-freezed<lb/> capsicum fruits were cut in strips and covered with brine of various composition 4 : 5 (capsicum : brine).<lb/> Samples A1 -A8 had 1.5% NaCl and 0.1% CaCI, in brine, but the brine of samples A3 and A4<lb/> contained also 0.1% potassium sorbate, A5 and A6 contained also phytoncide substance in higher<lb/> concentration and A7 and A8 contained phytoncide substance in lower concentration.<lb/> Before fermentation the contents of reducing sugars, pH and titratable acids were determined in<lb/> celeriac and in capsicum. The fermentation took place 10 days at a temperature of 23 &quot;C. We determined<lb/> organic acids in prepared samples using isotachophoresis. Measurements were made on CS Isotacho-<lb/>phoretic Analyser ZKI 01 (Spiiska N. Ves, CSFR) with a conductivity detector and a double line<lb/> recorder TZ 4200. Composition of leading and terminating electrolytes is published in KAROVICOVA<lb/> et al. [4].<lb/></div>
