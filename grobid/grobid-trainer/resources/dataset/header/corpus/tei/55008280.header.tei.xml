	<div type="abstract">Nineteen strains of lactic<lb/> acid producing bacteria of the genera Lactobacillus and Streptococcus collected<lb/> from different culture collections were screened for the production of extracellular<lb/> phytase. A number of them exhibited t h e enzyme activity in the fermentation<lb/> medium b u t Lactobacillus amylovorus B4552 produced the maximum amounts of phytase<lb/> ranging from 125 to 146 units ml-&apos; extracellularly under the submerged cultivation<lb/> conditions. T h e optimum glucose and inorganic phosphate levels for highest phytase<lb/> production were found to be 1% and 24% mg, respectively. Lactobacillus<lb/> amylovorus has potential in improving nutritional qualities of cereal and pulse-based<lb/> food fermentations.<lb/></div>
