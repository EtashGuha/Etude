		<div type="abstract">Abstract. Several types of multi-coordination methods for block-angular programs are considered. We present a computational comparison of synchronous multi-coordination methods. The most <lb/>efficient of these approaches is shown to involve an intermediate number of blocks in the coordination <lb/>phase. We also develop a new stabilization algorithm and present asynchronous multi-coordination <lb/>schemes, which are particularly useful when the number of blocks exceeds the number of available <lb/>processors or when the block sizes vary significantly. <lb/></div>
