	<div type="introduction">This is an old revision of this page, as edited by MerlIwBot (talk | contribs) at 22:54, 8 April 2011. It may differ<lb/> significantly from the current revision (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra) .<lb/> (diff) ← Previous revision | Latest revision (diff) | Newer revision → (diff)<lb/> In mathematics, the exterior product or wedge product of vectors is an algebraic construction<lb/> used in Euclidean geometry to study areas, volumes, and their higher-dimensional analogs. The<lb/> exterior product of two vectors u and v, denoted by u ∧ v, lies in a space called the exterior<lb/> square, a different geometrical space (vector space) than the original space of vectors. The<lb/> magnitude [1] of u ∧ v can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram with sides u and v,<lb/> which can also be computed using the cross product of the two vectors. Also like the cross<lb/> product, the exterior product is anticommutative, meaning that u ∧ v = −v ∧ u for all vectors u<lb/> and v. One way to visualize the exterior product of two vectors is as a family of parallelograms<lb/> all lying in the same plane, having the same area, and with the same orientation of their<lb/> boundaries (a decision of clockwise or counterclockwise). When thought of in this manner<lb/> (common in geometric algebra) the exterior product of two vectors is called a 2-blade. More<lb/> generally, the exterior product of any number k of vectors can be defined and is sometimes<lb/> called a k-blade. It lives in a geometrical space known as the k-th exterior power. The magnitude<lb/> of the resulting k-blade is the volume of the k-dimensional parallelotope whose sides are the<lb/> given vectors, just like the magnitude of the scalar triple product of vectors in three dimensions<lb/> gives the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by those vectors.<lb/> The exterior algebra (also known as the Grassmann algebra, after Hermann Grassmann<lb/> [2] ) is<lb/> the algebraic system whose product is the exterior product. The exterior algebra provides an<lb/> algebraic setting in which to answer geometric questions. For instance, whereas blades have a concrete geometrical interpretation,<lb/> objects in the exterior algebra can be manipulated according to a set of unambiguous rules. The exterior algebra contains objects that<lb/> are not just k-blades, but sums of k-blades. The k-blades, because they are simple products of vectors, are called the simple elements of<lb/> the algebra. The rank of any element of the exterior algebra is defined to be the smallest number of simple elements of which it is a sum.<lb/> An example when k = 2 is a symplectic form, which is an element of the exterior square whose rank is maximal. The exterior product<lb/> extends to the full exterior algebra, so that it make sense to multiply any two elements of the algebra. Equipped with this product, the<lb/> exterior algebra is an associative algebra, which means that α ∧ (β ∧ γ) = (α ∧ β) ∧ γ for any elements α, β, γ. The elements of the<lb/> algebra that are sums of k-blades are called the degree k-elements, and when elements of different degrees are multiplied, the degrees<lb/> add (like multiplication of polynomials). This means that the exterior algebra is a graded algebra.<lb/> In a precise sense (given by what is known as a universal construction), the exterior algebra is the largest algebra that supports an<lb/> alternating product on vectors, and can be easily defined in terms of other known objects such as tensors. The definition of the exterior<lb/> algebra makes sense for spaces not just of geometric vectors, but of other vector-like objects such as vector fields or functions. In full<lb/> generality, the exterior algebra can be defined for modules over a commutative ring, and for other structures of interest in abstract<lb/> algebra. It is one of these more general constructions where the exterior algebra finds one if its most important applications, where it<lb/> appears as the algebra of differential forms that is fundamental in areas that use differential geometry. Differential forms are<lb/> mathematical objects that represent infinitesimal areas of infinitesimal parallelograms (and higher-dimensional bodies), and so can be<lb/> integrated over surfaces and higher dimensional manifolds in a way that generalizes the line integrals from calculus. The exterior algebra<lb/> also has many algebraic properties that make it a convenient tool in algebra itself. The association of the exterior algebra to a vector<lb/> space is a type of functor on vector spaces, which means that it is compatible in a certain way with linear transformations of vector<lb/> spaces. The exterior algebra is one example of a bialgebra, meaning that its dual space also possesses a product, and this dual product is<lb/> compatible with the wedge product. This dual algebra is precisely the algebra of alternating multilinear forms on V, and the pairing<lb/> between the exterior algebra and its dual is given by the interior product.<lb/></div>
