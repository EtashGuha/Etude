	<div type="abstract">Sera from human immunodeficiency virus–1–infected participants in the Multicenter AIDS<lb/> Cohort Study were tested to assess the association between serum neutralizing antibodies<lb/> (NAbs) and disease progression. Each of 14 pairs, retrospectively matched for age, sex, race,<lb/> and CD4<lb/> + lymphocyte numbers early in the study, consisted of a rapid progressor (RP) who<lb/> developed AIDS and a long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) who remained asymptomatic. Serum<lb/> samples were drawn early, when all participants were asymptomatic, and late, when the RPs<lb/> had developed clinical AIDS. The LTNPs and RPs had similar levels of NAbs against primary<lb/> isolates at the early time point, indicating that NAb levels are not predictive of disease pro-<lb/>gression; at the late time point, the LTNPs had significantly higher titers because of an increase<lb/> in the level of serum NAbs in the LTNPs and/or a decrease in the NAbs in the RPs. The<lb/> patterns of neutralizing activity over time suggest that changes in effective NAbs against<lb/> different viruses do not occur in parallel.<lb/></div>

	<note type = "introduction"> Studies of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency<lb/> virus (HIV)–1 place the median point from the time of infection<lb/> to development of AIDS at ∼10 years. However, there is a small<lb/> population of HIV-1–infected individuals (∼5%) who remain<lb/> asymptomatic and maintain stable CD4<lb/> ϩ lymphocyte numbers<lb/> of beyond this time period; these individuals<lb/> 6<lb/> 1 500 ϫ 10 /L<lb/> have been designated &quot;long-term nonprogressors&quot; (LTNPs)<lb/> [1–3].
