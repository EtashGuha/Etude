		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>As databases increasingly integrate non-textual information <lb/>it is becoming necessary to support efficient similarity searching in addition to range searching. Recently, declustering <lb/>techniques have been proposed for improving the performance of similarity searches through parallel I/O. In this <lb/>paper, we propose a new scheme which provides good declus-tering for similarity searching. In particular, it does global <lb/>declustering as opposed to local declustering, exploits the <lb/>availability of extra disks and does not limit the partitioning of the data space. Our technique is based upon the <lb/>Cyclic declustering schemes which were developed for range <lb/>and partial match queries. We establish, in general, that <lb/>Cyclic declustering techniques outperform previously proposed techniques. <lb/></div>
