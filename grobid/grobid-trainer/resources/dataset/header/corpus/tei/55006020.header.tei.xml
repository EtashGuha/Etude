	<div type="abstract">To understand the details of the homeotic systems that govern flower development in tomato and to establish the ground<lb/> rules for the judicious manipulation of this floral system, we have isolated the tomato AGAMOUS gene, designated TAGí,<lb/> and examined its developmental role in antisense and sense transgenic plants. The AGAMOUS gene of Arabidopsis is<lb/> necessary for the proper development of stamens and carpels and the prevention of indeterminate growth of the floral<lb/> meristem. Early in flower development, TAGí RNA accumulates uniformly in the cells fated to differentiate into stamens<lb/> and carpels and later becomes restricted to specific cell types within these organs. Transgenic plants that express TAGí<lb/> antisense RNA display homeotic conversion of third whorl stamens into petaloid organs and the replacement of fourth<lb/> whorl carpels with pseudocarpels bearing indeterminate floral meristems with nested perianth flowers. A complemen-<lb/>tary phenotype was observed in transgenic plants expressing the TAGl sense RNA in that first whorl sepals were converted<lb/> into mature pericarpic leaves and sterile stamens replaced the second whorl petals.<lb/></div>
