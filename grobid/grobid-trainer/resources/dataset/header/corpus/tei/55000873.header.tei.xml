	<div type="abstract">1. Abstract<lb/> In the context of educational institutions, small distributed data centers and labs are<lb/> becoming increasingly expensive to provision, support and maintain on their own. This<lb/> leads to preferences towards centralized and integrated data center resource management<lb/> and network access to the resources. In turn, the data centers are undergoing a<lb/> transformation driven by the nature of the equipment in them, and by the way they are<lb/> used. As the computational and storage equipment becomes more powerful and more<lb/> densly packed, the power and cooling needs are growing as well. One of the challenges is<lb/> how to provision, manage and deliver such a large amount of physical and virtual<lb/> resources in an efficient way.<lb/> In this paper we discuss how

	technology can be used to implement distributed reconfigurable data<lb/> centers and IT services in educational institutions. We use the NC State VCL<lb/> implementation as a case study. It extends over four physical data centers and<lb/> encompasses over 2000 computational platforms â€“ most of them are IBM BladeCenter<lb/> TM<lb/> resources, some are HP, SUN and Dell platforms. VCL is an award-winning open source<lb/> implementation of a secure production-level on-demand utility computing and services<lb/> oriented technology for wide-area access to solutions based on real and virtualized<lb/> resources, including computational, storage, network and software resources. NC State<lb/> has been researching this technology and operating it in production settings since 2004.<lb/> Currently, NC State VCL is serving a student and faculty population of more than<lb/> 30,000. There also are VCL pilots with several UNC campuses, North Carolina<lb/> Community College System, and several of out-of-state universities.<lb/> VCL technology can host practically any other environment, overlay and virtualization<lb/> solution, from single-seat desktops in an operating system of choice, to high-performance<lb/> computing (HPC) clusters. It is a technology well suited for hosting &quot;cloud&quot; solutions of<lb/> almost any type. We discuss how this technology scales and what its return on investment<lb/> is, and how it can deliver clouds that offer a mix of resource architectures and ensembles,<lb/> including those that may integrate traditional main-frames (e.g., IBM System z and<lb/> System p platforms).</div>
