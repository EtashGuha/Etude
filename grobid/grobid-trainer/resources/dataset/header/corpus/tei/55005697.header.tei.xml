	<div type="abstract">Abstract. This paper describes a CAD system for the detection of colorectal<lb/> polyps in CT. It is based on stochastic shape and appearance modeling of struc-<lb/>tures of the colon and rectum, in contrast to the data-driven approaches more<lb/> commonly found in the literature it derives predictive stochastic models for the<lb/> features used for classification. The method makes extensive use of medical do-<lb/>main knowledge in the design of the models and in the setting of their parameters.<lb/> The proposed approach was successfully tested on challenging datasets acquired<lb/> under a protocol with little colonic preparation; such protocol reduces patient<lb/> discomfort and potentially improves compliance.<lb/></div>
