		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The FAA Aging Aircraft Research Program is <lb/>supporting the development of a robotic mobile <lb/>nondestructive inspection (NDI) instrument <lb/>deployment tool at Carnegie Mellon University <lb/>(CMU) with the active participation of USAir. The <lb/>program has spawned several new relationships <lb/>and entities: an alliance with an ARPA-funded <lb/>research program at CMU having the capability to <lb/>add 3D-stereoscopic enhanced visual inspection <lb/>capability, a start-up company organized to <lb/>commercialize the combined technologies, and <lb/>State of Pennsylvania funding to foster this <lb/>commercialization. As a result of these activities <lb/>and connections the civilian sector appears to be <lb/>ahead of the military sector in important aspects of <lb/>automation for deployment of aircraft inspection <lb/>equipment. A partnership between the university <lb/>researchers, the airline operator, the start-up <lb/>company, and the state government is thus <lb/>emerging as the likely agent for transfer of the <lb/>civilian-developed technology to the military sector. <lb/></div>
