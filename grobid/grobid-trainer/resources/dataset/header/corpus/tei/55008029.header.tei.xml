	<div type="abstract">Sera from 210 patients with Lyme borreliosis (LB) were studied by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay<lb/> (ELISA) based on a synthetic peptide (pepC10) comprising the C-terminal 10-amino-acid residues of OspC of<lb/> Borrelia burgdorferi. We found that 36.3 and 45.0% of the serum samples from patients with erythema migrans<lb/> (EM) and neuroborreliosis (NB), respectively, displayed immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-pepC10 reactivities,<lb/> while these samples rarely (&lt;8%) displayed IgG antibody reactivities. Sera from patients with acrodermatitis<lb/> chronica atrophicans did not contain anti-pepC10 antibodies. The diagnostic performance of this newly<lb/> developed peptide ELISA was compared with those of an ELISA based on the full-length recombinant OspC<lb/> protein (rOspC) and a commercially available ELISA based on the B. burgdorferi flagellum (Fla). The<lb/> sensitivity of the IgM pepC10 ELISA was slightly lower (P Ͻ 0.04) than that of the rOspC ELISA for EM<lb/> patients (36.3 versus 43.8%), while there was no difference for NB patients (45.0 versus 48.0%). However, the<lb/> optical density values obtained by the pepC10 ELISA were generally higher than those obtained by the rOspC<lb/> ELISA, leading to a significantly better quantitative discrimination between seropositive patients with NB and<lb/> controls (P Ͻ 0.008). The specificity of the pepC10 ELISA was similar to those of the rOspC ELISA and the<lb/> Fla ELISA for relevant controls including patients with syphilis and mononucleosis. Although the overall<lb/> diagnostic sensitivity of the Fla ELISA was superior, 8.8 and 12.0% of the EM and NB patients, respectively,<lb/> were antibody positive only by the pepC10 ELISA. Thus, use of a diagnostic test for LB based on the detection<lb/> of IgM antibodies to pepC10 and Fla has increased sensitivity for the diagnosis of early LB.<lb/></div>
