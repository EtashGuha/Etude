		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Modulo scheduling algorithms based on optimal <lb/>solvers have been proposed to investigate and tune the <lb/>performance of modulo scheduling heuristics. While <lb/>recent advances have broadened the scope for which <lb/>the optimal approach is applicable, this approach <lb/>increasingly suffers from large execution times. In this <lb/>paper, we propose a more efficient formulation of the <lb/>modulo scheduling space that significantly decreases <lb/>the execution time of solvers based on integer linear <lb/>programs. For example, the total execution time is <lb/>reduced by a factor of 8.6 when 782 loops from the <lb/>Perfect Club, SPEC, and Livermore Fortran Kernels <lb/>are scheduled for minimum register requirements using <lb/>the more efficient formulation instead of the traditional <lb/>formulation. Experimental evidence further indicates <lb/>that significantly larger loops can be scheduled under <lb/>realistic machine constraints. <lb/></div>
