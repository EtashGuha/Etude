		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper proposes a framework for predicate detection in systems of processes with approximately-synchronized real-time clocks. Timestamps from these clocks are used to define two orderings on <lb/>events: &quot;definitely occurred before&quot; and &quot;possibly occurred before&quot;. These orderings lead naturally <lb/>to definitions of 3 distinct detection modalities, i.e., 3 meanings of &quot;predicate held during a computation&quot;, namely: Poss T (&quot; possibly held&quot;), Def T (&quot; definitely held&quot;), and Inst (&quot; <lb/>definitely held at a specific instant&quot;). This paper defines these modalities and gives efficient algorithms for detecting them; the algorithms are based on algorithms of Cooper and Marzullo, Garg <lb/>and Waldecker, and Fromentin and Raynal. <lb/></div>
