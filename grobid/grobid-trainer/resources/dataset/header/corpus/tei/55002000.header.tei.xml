	<div type="introduction">2005 comes to an end after two successful events for our project into automated city transport -<lb/>The annual mobilicity seminar at the Royal College of Art, London attracted<lb/> both a full house on the day and great media coverage in the following weeks.<lb/> The research carried out from Oct 04 to Oct 05 was presented and this was<lb/> followed by a lively discussion about the potential and challenges of<lb/> developing the innovative system. The expert audience included transport<lb/> professionals, researchers, designers and both the transport &amp; general press.<lb/> The AATS 2005 conference in Bologna was another perfect venue to<lb/> present mobilicity since it was essentially a global forum for<lb/> automated transport. A number of similar systems are being developed<lb/> as the great benefits – in terms of cost and efficiency – become clear.<lb/> The next big date is in January 2006 for the NAIAS in Detroit. mobilicity has been selected for the<lb/> Michelin Challenge Design by their panel of expert judges, including Dr Paul MacCready of<lb/> Gossamer Condor fame, and Gordon Murray. The 1:5 scale model is just being completed at the<lb/> Vehicle Design Department at the RCA. The model will now be flown to the USA ready for show.<lb/> 2006 overall will be a twelve month period of R&amp;D and commercial promotion of the mobilicity<lb/> project. A number of shows &amp; conferences have been planned to present both technical and<lb/> commercial aspects of mobilicity. This program will be developed together with our partners.</div>
