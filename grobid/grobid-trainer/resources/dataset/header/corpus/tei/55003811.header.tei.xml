	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Multispectral imaging technology was applied to deteriorated ancient manuscripts. Monochrome images were<lb/> registered at twelve wavelengths. An image processing algorithm that utilises relative spectral intensity<lb/> distribution for the areas of the surface (rather than absolute values of intensity of the reflected light) was<lb/> evaluated. It was found that the areas in a cubed MSI image representing ink and papyrus were separable due<lb/> to their distinctive spectral signatures. The developed technique for enhancing the contrast of the inscriptions<lb/> was shown to work effectively over a large range of lightness for both ink and papyrus surface.<lb/> Multispectral imaging (MSI), image processing, material detection, ancient-text imaging, papyrus, Papyrology.<lb/></div>
