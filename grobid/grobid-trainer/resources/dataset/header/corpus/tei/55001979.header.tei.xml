	<div type="abstract">Abstract. A protein fraction containing y-bu~obet~ne<lb/> hydroxylase (sp.act. 1.54 mU/mg) was isolated<lb/> from the rat liver by differential pre~pi~tion<lb/> with arnrno~~<lb/> sulphate. 3-(2,2,2-T~methylhydra-<lb/>zinium)propionate (THP), a noncompetitive enzyme inhibitor, when administered orally to rats for 10<lb/> days (150 mg/kg) elicited a reduction in myocardial free camitine and long-chain acyl carnitine content<lb/> by 63.7 and 74.3%, respectively. This reduction in free camitine concentration causes a suppression of<lb/> the free fatty acid oxidation, as measured by the production of i4C02 and ketone bodies. The inhibition<lb/> of fatty acid oxidation is particularly manifest when their metabolism is stimulated by feeding a fat-rich<lb/> diet to the animals or in fasting rats.The inhibition of fatty acid metabolism at the stage of activation<lb/> (acyl carnitine fo~ation) can account for the ~r~oprot~tive<lb/> effect of THP, which is assessed by its<lb/> ability to prevent a decrease in A&apos;IP level and myocardial energy charge as well as to prevent a rise in<lb/> creatine phosphokinase and lactic dehydrogenase (myocardium-specific isozyme) activity in rat blood<lb/> serum in response to isoproterenol and epinephrine. Regulation of the carnitine-dependent fatty acid<lb/> metabolism in ischaemia is a pathogenetically justified approach to pharmacological treatment of<lb/> ischaemic myocardium. In its biochemical mechanism, THP sign&amp;ally distinguishes itself from other<lb/> known inhibitors of fatty acid oxidation.<lb/> </div>
<div type="introduction">Impairment of lipid metabolism occurring in myo-<lb/>cardial cells in ischaemia belongs to the main bio-<lb/>chemical pathogenetic manifestations of the disease.<lb/> The level of free fatty acids and products of their<lb/> metabolic activation-acyl<lb/> carnitine and acyl-CoA-<lb/>possessing some properties of detergents becomes<lb/> elevated in response to adrenergic stimulation [l-3].<lb/> Inadequate supply of oxygen and the ensuing failure<lb/> of the myocardium to oxidise NADH2 and FADHz<lb/> result in the in~bition of fatty acid oxidation and<lb/> accumulation of their metabolites, e.g. &amp;hydroxy-<lb/>acyl CoA [4,5], The products of fatty acid activation<lb/> and partially oxidised metabolites exert a destabil-<lb/>ising effect on mitochondrial membranes and are<lb/> capable of suppressing the activity of adeninenucleo-<lb/>tide translocase [6,7].<lb/> A rise in acyl carnitine and acyl-CoA con-<lb/>centration in the mitochond~a reflects the inability<lb/> of mycardial cells to oxidise large amounts of fatty<lb/> acids in ischaemic heart, while an increase in acyl-<lb/>CoA concentration in the cytoplasm can be caused<lb/> by free carnitine deficiency observed in ischaemic<lb/> myocardium [S-lo].<lb/> After establishing the fact that ischaemic myo-<lb/>cardium is depleted of carnitine, a~inis~ation<lb/> of exogenous camitine has been proposed as a means<lb/> of restituting fatty acid metabolism.
