			<div type="abstract">The Telecommunications Industry has undergone major paradigm shifts
				in<lb/> the previous years[4]. One of these is the shift from circuit-switched<lb/>
				networks towards packet-switched networks. There is hardly any doubt<lb/> anymore
				that IP will be the ubiquitous transport protocol for multimedia of<lb/> the
				future.<lb/> At present the work towards Internet telephony has attracted a lot
				of<lb/> attention. Two standards have been developed: SIP [1] by the Internet<lb/>
				Engineering Task Force (IETF) and H.323 [2] by the International<lb/>
				Telecommunications Union (ITU).<lb/> As has been shown by an initial study[5] the
				rapid deployment of services<lb/> on top of SIP is hindered by a well known problem
				- Feature Interactions.<lb/> As in traditional telephony networks Feature
				Interactions are also a serious<lb/> problem between services deployed on IP-based
				networks. In this paper, the<lb/> technological changes in SIP compared to the
				traditional telephony network<lb/> are highlighted as well as the impact of the
				changed business environment.<lb/> In a multi-service provider environment (as
				encouraged by a SIP<lb/> environment) the feature interaction problem is regarded to
				be an even<lb/> more pressing issue. Services of different providers from a
				multitude of<lb/> service creators are likely to interwork. This in turn leads to
				the fact that the<lb/> ad-hoc approaches to service interaction handling commonly
				applied in the<lb/> industry today will not be sufficient anymore.<lb/> In this
				paper a new approach addressing these changes is introduced and the<lb/> results of
				a case study are presented.<lb/></div>
