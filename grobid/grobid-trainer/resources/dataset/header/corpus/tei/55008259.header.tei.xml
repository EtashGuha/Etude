	<div type="abstract">Abstract â€”Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flow is a flow of electrically neutral gas caused by<lb/> corona-generated ions drifting through it. Many aspects of this gas movement phenomenon<lb/> such as electric field and charge distribution, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer have been<lb/> investigated, and the use of accurate models have become critical in the development of com-<lb/>mercial applications in this field. The purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate that<lb/> corona induced airflow can be successfully modeled using COMSOL multiphysics, a com-<lb/>mercial software package that performs equation-based multiphysics modeling for different<lb/> physical processes by applying the finite element method to the system of partial differential<lb/> equations. Governing equations, boundary conditions, and numerical results obtained with<lb/> COMSOL multiphysics are presented, and compared with experimental results. Numerical<lb/> results are found to be in good agreement with experimental results.<lb/></div>
