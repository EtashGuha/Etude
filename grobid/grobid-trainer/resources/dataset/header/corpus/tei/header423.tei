		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The aim of this paper is to identify and to characterize the features that render one class <lb/>of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) computationally more efficient. Our approach <lb/>is to search for a causal structure not only in the topology of the subsets of variables upon <lb/>which the constraints are specified, but also in the nature of the constraints. Basically, there <lb/>should exist an ordering of variables in the system such that an assignment of the variables <lb/>can be reached without backtracking. First, an approach of a causal structure is formulated, <lb/>and second, an efficient procedure is provided (i) for deciding if such an ordering of variables <lb/>exists and, (ii) for identifying such an ordering whenever possible. <lb/></div>
