			<div type="abstract">The phenomenon of the throbbing of glow dis- <lb/>
charges was first studied by Thomson [1] in 1931. <lb/>
The discharge tubes he used were probably covered <lb/>
with a sputtered film and the gas pressure was not <lb/>
controlled. He explained this phenomenon by the <lb/>
electrical charging of the tube walls. Since Thomson's <lb/>
paper there has been virtually no work on this <lb/>
interesting phenomenon. In this note we report on <lb/>
throbbing phenomena in tubes free from a sputtered <lb/>
film and suggest that in this situation the mechanism <lb/>
is the formation and decay of the negative ions in <lb/>
the gas rather than electrical charging of the walls <lb/>
of the tube. <lb/></div>
