	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The efficiency of overhead power lines can be increased by series compensation or HVDC transmission.<lb/> These complex systems can be protected from overvoltages by metal oxide surge arresters. Both porcelain<lb/> and polymer tube design surge arresters are used for these applications, however, polymer tube design<lb/> surge arresters offer various advantages over porcelain arresters such as light weight, extremely high<lb/> mechanical resistance and safe short circuit behaviour. Type and routine tests of surge arresters for series<lb/> compensation and HVDC stations ensure the general functionality and quality of these devices. The rating of<lb/> surge arresters for series compensation and HVDC stations follows different consideration as the rating of<lb/> standard high voltage surge arresters. While the latter ones are rated by mainly taking standard lightning,<lb/> switching and temporary overvoltages into consideration, the rating of surge arresters for series<lb/> compensation and HVDC converter stations is given by internal overvoltages due to operating and fault<lb/> conditions.<lb/></div>
