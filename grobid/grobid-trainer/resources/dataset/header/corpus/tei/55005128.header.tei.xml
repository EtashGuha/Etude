			<div type="abstract">a b s t r a c t<lb/> This work deals with state estimation in the
				presence of delayed and infrequent measurements. While<lb/> most measurements
				(referred to as secondary measurements) are available frequently and instanta-<lb/>
				neously, there might be a delay associated with acquiring other measurements
				(primary measurements)<lb/> due to long analysis times involved. The primary
				measurements are usually sampled at irregular inter-<lb/> vals and the exact delay
				is also unknown. The traditional fixed-lag smoothing algorithm, which has been<lb/>
				applied for a variety of chemical processes systems, can be computationally
				inefficient for such situations<lb/> and alternate methods to handle delays are
				necessary. In this paper, we analyze several existing methods<lb/> to incorporate
				measurement delays and reinterpret their results under a common unified
				framework<lb/> (for Extended Kalman Filter). Extensions to handle time-varying and
				uncertain delays, as well as out of<lb/> sequence measurement arrival are also
				presented. Simulation studies on a linear distillation column and<lb/> a nonlinear
				polymerization reactor are used to compare the performance of these methods based
				on<lb/> RMSE values and computation times. A large scale nonlinear reactive
				distillation column example is also<lb/> used to illustrate the practicality of the
				suggested method.<lb/>
