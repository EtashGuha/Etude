		<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT <lb/>This paper discusses several current attempts to use acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation for modeling <lb/>physical phenomena and the role that wavelet analysis is playing in these efforts. The first problem involves recent <lb/>application of wavelets to computational fluid dynamics. The second problem involves geophysical modeling of the <lb/>ocean floor, using acoustic waves, and wavelets have recently been shown to play an important role here already. <lb/>The third problem involves modeling of SAR radar images in the context of automatic target recognition efforts. <lb/>The fourth problem is global illumination in computer graphics, i.e., simulation of reflected and absorbed light <lb/>for everyday environments. The role of wavelets is more embryonic in these latter two areas, but there are some <lb/>common principles in all of these modeling efforts, and the methodology of wavelets seems well suited to certain <lb/>aspects of these problems. <lb/></div>
