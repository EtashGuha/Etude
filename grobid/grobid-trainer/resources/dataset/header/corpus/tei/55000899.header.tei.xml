	<div type="introduction">Award&apos;s BIOS ROM has a built-in setup program that allows users to modify the<lb/> basic system configuration. This information is stored in CMOS RAM so that it<lb/> can retain the setup information, even when the power is turned off.<lb/> When you turn on or restart the system, press the Delete key to enter the Award<lb/> BIOS setup program. The primary screen as shown in Figure 3-1 is a list of the menus<lb/> and functions available in the setup program. Select the desired item and press enter<lb/> to make changes. Operating commands are located at the bottom of this and all<lb/> other BIOS screens. When a field is highlighted, on-line help information is displayed<lb/> on the right side of the screen.<lb/>

	3-1 Standard CMOS Feature<lb/>

	The Standard CMOS Feature allows users to configure system components such as<lb/> hard disk drive, floppy disk drive and video display as well as date, time and boot<lb/> up error signaling. This configuration menu should be changed when installing a<lb/> mainboard for the first time, changing hardware in your system such as the HDD,<lb/> FDD, video display, or when the CMOS data has been lost or contaminated. Choose<lb/> the Standard CMOS Setup option from the CMOS Setup Utility menu (Figure 3-<lb/>1) to display the following screen. When a field is highlighted, on-line help<lb/> information is displayed on the left bottom edge of the screen.<lb/> Date/Time<lb/> Set the date and time. Do not skip this function as all of your timed events such<lb/> as power management, saving files, etc. are based on this timer.</div>
