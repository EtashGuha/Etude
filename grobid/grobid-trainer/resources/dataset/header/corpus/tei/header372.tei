		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We propose a hierarchical control architecture for dealing with faults and adverse environmental conditions on an Automated Highway System (AHS). Our design extends <lb/>a previous control architecture that works under normal conditions of operation. The <lb/>faults that are considered in our design are classified according to the capabilities remaining on the vehicle or roadside after the fault has occurred. Information about these <lb/>capabilities is used by supervisors in each of the layers of the architecture to select appropriate control strategies. We outline the extended control strategies that are needed <lb/>by these supervisors and, in certain cases, give examples of their detailed operation. <lb/></div>
