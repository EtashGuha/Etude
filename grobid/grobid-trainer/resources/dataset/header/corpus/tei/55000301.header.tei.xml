	<div type="abstract">An optimal continuous production of biodiesel by methanolysis of soybean oil in a packed-bed reactor was developed using<lb/> immobilized lipase (Novozym 435) as a catalyst in a tert-butanol solvent system. Response surface methodology (RSM) and Box-<lb/>Behnken design were employed to evaluate the effects of reaction temperature, flow rate, and substrate molar ratio on the molar<lb/> conversion of biodiesel. The results showed that flow rate and temperature have significant effects on the percentage of molar<lb/> conversion. On the basis of ridge max analysis, the optimum conditions were as follows: flow rate 0.1 mL/min, temperature 52.1<lb/> @BULLET C,<lb/> and substrate molar ratio 1 : 4. The predicted and experimental values of molar conversion were 83.31 ± 2.07% and 82.81 ± .98%,<lb/> respectively. Furthermore, the continuous process over 30 days showed no appreciable decrease in the molar conversion. The paper<lb/> demonstrates the applicability of using immobilized lipase and a packed-bed reactor for continuous biodiesel synthesis.<lb/></div>
