		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In this paper, syntactic parsing is discussed in the context of connectionism. A new model - the Confluent <lb/>Preorder Parser (CPP), is proposed which exemplifies the holistic parsing paradigm. Holistic parsing has the <lb/>advantage that little assumption has to be made concerning the detailed parsing algorithm, which is often <lb/>unknown or debatable, especially when human language understanding is concerned. In the CPP, syntactic <lb/>parsing is achieved by transforming in a oneshot manner, from the connectionist representation of the sentence <lb/>to the connectionist representation of the preorder traversal of its parse tree, instead of the parse tree itself. As <lb/>revealed by the simulation experiments, generalization performance is excellent (as high as 90%). Besides, the <lb/>CPP is also capable of parsing erroneous sentences and resolving syntactic ambiguities. A systematic study is <lb/>conducted to explore the range of factors which can affect the effectiveness of it. This error-recovery capability <lb/>is especially useful in natural language processing when incomplete or even ungrammatical sentences are to be <lb/>dealt with. <lb/></div>
