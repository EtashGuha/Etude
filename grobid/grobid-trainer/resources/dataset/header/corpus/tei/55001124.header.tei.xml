	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Driven by the market success of high-quality Voice over<lb/> IP technology, the introduction of wideband telephony<lb/> with an acoustic bandwidth of at least 7 kHz is mean-<lb/>while also foreseen for &quot;traditional&quot; digital voice com-<lb/>munication services such as ISDN, DECT, or UMTS.<lb/> While wideband speech addresses the basic requirement<lb/> of intelligibility (even for meaningless syllables), the per-<lb/>ceived &quot;naturalness&quot; and the experienced &quot;quality&quot; of<lb/> speech can be further enhanced by providing an even<lb/> larger acoustic bandwidth. Thus, the next logical step<lb/> towards true &quot;Hi-Fi Telephony&quot; could be the rendering of<lb/> &quot;super-wideband&quot; (SWB) speech signals with an acoustic<lb/> bandwidth of at least 14 kHz.<lb/> In this contribution, we review previous and current<lb/> standardization activities with this focus. Moreover,<lb/> a method for artificial bandwidth extension (BWE) of<lb/> wideband speech signals towards &quot;super-wideband&quot; is<lb/> presented and evaluated. It is shown that improved nat-<lb/>uralness and speech quality can be attained by a purely<lb/> receiver-based modification of wideband terminals.</div>
