	<div type="abstract">A theory of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) amplitudes is developed for a model in<lb/> which the crystal surface is represented by a step-function termination of the bulk crystal potential<lb/> ("bare-substrate" model). The crystal is considered to be centro-symmetric and it is assumed that<lb/> either the crystal has a two-fold axis of rotation normal to the surface or the primay beam is<lb/> normally incident on the surface. The origin of coordinates is taken to lie at a center of symmetry<lb/> of the substrate crystal. The diffraction amplitude is considered as a function of complex electron<lb/> energy. For a real potential it is shown to have the following properties:<lb/> 1. The imaginary part of the amplitude vanishes at each branch point of the amplitude function;<lb/> 2. There are certain segments of the real-energy axis, called "inactive" segments, throughout<lb/> which the imaginary part of the amplitude vanishes approximately.<lb/> The theoretical results are illustrated by a numerical example. It is suggested that the diffrac-<lb/>tion amplitude can be represented by a simple expression that has the correct functional form<lb/> and that satisfies the appropriate dispersion relation. One such expression is proposed and discussed<lb/> in comparison with exact computational results.<lb/></div>
