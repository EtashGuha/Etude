	<titlePart>ROCIMA™ 63 Industrial Microbicide<lb/> For Use in Exterior Paints, Coatings and Building Materials<lb/> (EPA Registration: 707-303)<lb/></titlePart>
	</docTitle>

	<div type="abstract">General Description<lb/> ROCIMA 63 microbicide is a dry film preservative that contains three different active ingredients for exceptional<lb/> performance against a broad range of fungi and algae. It provides superior protection of all exterior coatings,<lb/> where algae can be a challenge. Such surfaces are often covered with airborne particles from industrial production<lb/> and internal combustion engines, soil and fertilizer, pollen and other particulates. This material serves as a<lb/> substrate for microorganisms.<lb/> ROCIMA 63 microbicide is a fluid, pumpable dispersion of active ingredients. It is easy to handle, meter and<lb/> incorporate into aqueous systems.<lb/> ROCIMA 63 microbicide is registered for exterior use in paints, stains, building materials, stucco, caulks and<lb/> sealants.<lb/> </div>

	<div type="introduction">Performance Benefits<lb/> z Long-lasting broad spectrum protection: given the complementary nature of its three active ingredients,<lb/> ROCIMA 63 microbicide offers durable protection against the growth of fungi and algae.<lb/> z Two modes of protective action: One prevents the treated surface from serving as the substrate for<lb/> contaminating micro-organisms to grow and proliferate; Two, when the surface becomes wet through rain<lb/> or condensation, the controlled diffusion of the active ingredients into the wet phase prevents the growth of<lb/> micro-organisms on the surface layer.<lb/> z ROCIMA 63 microbicide can be used alone or in combination with ROZONE™ 2000 microbicide, ROCIMA<lb/> 200 microbicide or SKANE™ M-8 mildewcide. </div>
