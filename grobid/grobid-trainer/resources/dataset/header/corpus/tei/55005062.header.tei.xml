			<div type="abstract"> Abstract<lb/> Conventional AFM is highly restricted by its scan
				rate, a problem that has been overcome by<lb/> the development of high-speed AFM
				systems. As the technology to produce higher scan rates<lb/> has developed it has
				pushed forward the design of control software. However, the user interface<lb/> has
				not evolved at the same rate, limiting the user to sequential control steps. In this
				paper we<lb/> demonstrate the integration of HSAFM with a multitouch interface to
				produce a highly intuitive<lb/> and responsive control environment. This enables
				nanometre resolution to be maintained whilst<lb/> scanning the sample over tens of
				microns, and arbitrary paths to be traversed. We illustrate this<lb/> by scanning
				around two chromosomes in water, before scanning on top of the chromosome,<lb/>
				showing the surface structure.<lb/>
