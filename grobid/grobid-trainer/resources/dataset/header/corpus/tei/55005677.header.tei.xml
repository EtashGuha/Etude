	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The refractive index of a material is one of the most important optical<lb/> parameters. In this review article we have discussed diÂ¡erent methods and<lb/> techniques for the measurement of refractive indices of various materials.<lb/> We have considered the literature of the past two decades from 1980 to 2001<lb/> and have shown how the techniques have been developed and improved<lb/> for the measurement of refractive indices. Some applications of refractive<lb/> index have also been discussed.<lb/></div>
