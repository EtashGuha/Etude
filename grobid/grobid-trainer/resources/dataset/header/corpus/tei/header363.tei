		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Rules extracted from trained feedforward networks <lb/>can be used for explanation, validation, and cross-referencing of network output decisions. This paper <lb/>introduces a rule evaluation and ordering mechanism <lb/>that orders rules extracted from feedforward networks <lb/>based on three performance measures. Detailed experiments using three rule extraction techniques as applied <lb/>to the Wisconsin breast cancer database, illustrate the <lb/>power of the proposed methods. Moreover, a method <lb/>of integrating the output decisions of both the extracted <lb/>rule-based system and the corresponding trained network is proposed. The integrated system provides further improvements. <lb/></div>
