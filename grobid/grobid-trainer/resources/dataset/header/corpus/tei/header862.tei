		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Introspective reasoning about a system&apos;s own <lb/>reasoning processes can form the basis for <lb/>learning to refine those reasoning processes. <lb/>The ROBBIE 1 system uses introspective reasoning to monitor the retrieval process of a <lb/>case-based planner to detect retrieval of inappropriate cases. When retrieval problems <lb/>are detected, the source of the problems is explained and the explanations are used to determine new indices to use during future case <lb/>retrieval. The goal of ROBBIE&apos;s learning is to <lb/>increase its ability to focus retrieval on relevant <lb/>cases, with the aim of simultaneously decreasing the number of candidates to consider and <lb/>increasing the likelihood that the system will be <lb/>able to successfully adapt the retrieved cases to <lb/>fit the current situation. We evaluate the benefits of the approach in light of empirical results <lb/>examining the effects of index learning in the <lb/>ROBBIE system. <lb/></div>
