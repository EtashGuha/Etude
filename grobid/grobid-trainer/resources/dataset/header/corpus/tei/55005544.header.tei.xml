	<div type="abstract">The 3؅-untranslated region of the Sindbis virus genome is 0.3 kb in length with a 19-nucleotide conserved<lb/> sequence element (3؅ CSE) immediately preceding the 3؅-poly(A) tail. The 3؅ CSE and poly(A) tail have been<lb/> assumed to constitute the core promoter for minus-strand RNA synthesis during genome replication; however,<lb/> their involvement in this process has not been formally demonstrated. Utilizing both in vitro and in vivo<lb/> analyses, we have examined the role of these elements in the initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis. The<lb/> major findings of this study with regard to efficient minus-strand RNA synthesis are the following: (i) the<lb/> wild-type 3؅ CSE and the poly(A) tail are required, (ii) the poly(A) tail must be a minimum of 11 to 12 residues<lb/> in length and immediately follow the 3؅ CSE, (iii) deletion or substitution of the 3؅ 13 nucleotides of the 3؅ CSE<lb/> severely inhibits minus-strand RNA synthesis, (iv) templates possessing non-wild-type 3؅ sequences previously<lb/> demonstrated to support virus replication do not program efficient RNA synthesis, and (v) insertion of<lb/> uridylate residues between the poly(A) tail and a non-wild-type 3؅ sequence can restore promoter function to<lb/> a limited extent. This study shows that the optimal structure of the 3؅ component of the minus-strand promoter<lb/> is the wild-type 3؅ CSE followed a poly(A) tail of at least 11 residues. Our findings also show that insertion of<lb/> nontemplated bases can restore function to an inactive promoter.<lb/> </div>
	
	<div type="introduction">Synthesis of the minus-sense copy of a plus-sense RNA virus<lb/> genome constitutes the first step in genome replication. De-<lb/>termining how this process occurs is a fundamental require-<lb/>ment for understanding the early events in virus replication.<lb/> Alphaviruses are a group of medically and economically<lb/> important positive-sense RNA viruses that are amenable to<lb/> genetic analysis (22, 55). Full-length DNA copies of the ge-<lb/>nomes have been used to study the roles of viral proteins and<lb/> cis-acting elements in the processes of virus replication and<lb/> pathogenesis (8, 9, 30, 33, 39, 47). Additionally, alphavirus-<lb/>based vector systems are becoming widely used in the fields of<lb/> gene and vaccine delivery (1, 14, 19, 36, 40, 41, 59).<lb/> Sindbis virus (SIN) is the type species and one of the best-<lb/>studied members of the alphavirus genus (22, 55). The SIN<lb/> genome is a single strand of RNA with positive polarity 11,703<lb/> nucleotides (nt) in length exclusive of the 5Ј cap and 3Ј polyade-<lb/>nylate tail and thus closely resembles a eukaryotic mRNA (54).<lb/> Upon introduction to the host cell cytosol the genome serves as a<lb/> template for translation of the viral nonstructural polyproteins<lb/> P123 and P1234. P1234, produced by translational readthrough of<lb/> an opal codon at the 3Ј end of the nsP3 coding sequence, is<lb/> initially processed to P123 and nsP4 by the nsP2-associated pro-<lb/>teinase activity (10, 13, 24, 25, 37, 38). nsP4 is the catalytic subunit<lb/> of the viral replicase/transcriptase, possessing RNA-dependent<lb/> RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity. In complex with P123, nsP4<lb/> serves to copy the viral genome into a full-length complementary<lb/> RNA (minus-strand) (34, 35, 52). Proteolytic processing of P123<lb/> by the nsP2 proteinase, specifically cleavage at the 2/3 junction,<lb/> turns off minus-strand RNA synthesis and switches the RNA<lb/> synthetic activity of the complex to plus-strand genomic and sub-<lb/>genomic RNA synthesis (35, 52).<lb/> Recent work has demonstrated that the 5Ј end of the SIN<lb/> genome is important for minus-strand RNA synthesis, a pro-<lb/>cess that initiates at the 3Ј end of the genome (18, 21). Similar<lb/> 5Ј requirements have been found for other positive-sense RNA<lb/> viruses (2, 6, 26, 56, 58). While the 5Ј end of the genome is<lb/> important for facilitating efficient production of the replication<lb/> intermediate, the 3Ј end of the genome is considered to be the<lb/> core promoter for minus-strand RNA synthesis. In order to<lb/> achieve productive replication of viable progeny, virus initia-<lb/>tion of minus-strand synthesis must occur at or close to the 3Ј<lb/> terminus of the genome to prevent loss of genetic information.<lb/> The 3Ј-noncoding regions of a number of positive-sense RNA<lb/> viruses have been demonstrated to play a role in regulating<lb/> minus-strand RNA synthesis (11, 27, 29, 42, 43, 53, 58). How-<lb/>ever, a rigorous analysis of requirements in this region for<lb/> efficient initiation of SIN minus-strand RNA synthesis has not<lb/> been performed.<lb/> The 3Ј end of the SIN genome consists of a polyadenylate<lb/> tail preceded by a sequence element 19 nucleotides in length<lb/> that is highly conserved across the alphavirus genus (3Ј CSE)<lb/> (45, 54). In studies by Kuhn et al., specific mutations in the 3Ј<lb/> CSE were found to inhibit virus production or to bestow a<lb/> temperature sensitive phenotype on the virus, but the point at<lb/> which these mutations exert their effect was not defined (32).<lb/> Additionally, while it has been proposed that minus-strand<lb/> RNA synthesis is initiated on the poly(A) tail, the need for the<lb/> poly(A) tail during genome copying has not been demon-<lb/>strated, nor has a specific size requirement been defined (16,<lb/> 49). Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that viral<lb/> genomes lacking or possessing partial deletions of the 3Ј CSE<lb/> and the poly(A) tail can function or were repaired to a func-</div>
