	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> This paper investigates the detection of global abnormal<lb/> behaviours across a network of CCTV cameras. Although<lb/> the problem of multiple camera tracking has attracted much<lb/> attention recently, little work has been done on modelling<lb/> global behaviours of objects monitored by a network of<lb/> CCTV cameras with disjointed camera views, and no effort<lb/> has been taken to tackle the challenging problem of detect-<lb/>ing abnormal global behaviours, which are only meaning-<lb/>ful and recognisable when observed over space and time<lb/> across multiple camera views. To that end, we propose a<lb/> novel framework, which consists of object tracking across<lb/> camera views, global behaviour modelling based on unsu-<lb/>pervised learning, and probabilistic abnormality inference.<lb/> The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated with ex-<lb/>periments on real-world surveillance video data.<lb/></div>
