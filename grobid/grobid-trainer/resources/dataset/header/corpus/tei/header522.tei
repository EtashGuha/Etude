		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>A proof of the soundness of Tofte&apos;s imperative type discipline with respect to a structured operational <lb/>semantics is given. The presentation is based on a semantic formalism that combines the benefits of the <lb/>approaches considered by Wright and Felleisen, and by Tofte, leading to a particularly simple proof of <lb/>soundness of Tofte&apos;s type discipline. <lb/></div>
