			<div type="abstract"> a b s t r a c t<lb/> The main objective of this work is to
				determine and design a suitable wind turbine which could be employed<lb/> for rural
				homes or other small-scale applications. A variety of horizontal and vertical axis
				wind turbines exist,<lb/> each possessing a number of advantages and disadvantages
				which needed to be taken into account before a<lb/> basis for the design is
				selected. A small robust design which is relatively simple and cheap to construct is
				in<lb/> essence the main criteria for wind turbine selection. A Savonius type rotor,
				which is a rotor based on a<lb/> modification of the ‘S’ rotor, is selected as it
				best fitted the design criteria. A small prototype 1.5 m tall with a<lb/> rotor
				diameter of 0.65 m is designed and built. The finished prototype is used to estimate
				the power<lb/> obtainable under normal operating conditions.<lb/>
