	<titlePart>Synta Pharmaceuticals Announces Updated Elesclomol SYMMETRYSM Data Presented At<lb/> Melanoma XIII<lb/></titlePart>

	<div type="introduction">Click to Print<lb/> Synta Pharmaceuticals Corp. (NASDAQ: SNTA), a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering,<lb/> developing, and commercializing small molecule drugs to treat severe medical conditions, announced<lb/> that additional results from its Phase 3 trial (SYMMETRYSM) of elesclomol in combination with paclitaxel<lb/> in metastatic melanoma was presented at the Perspectives in Melanoma XIII Conference by Steven<lb/> O&apos;Day, M.D., principal investigator and Chief of Research and Director of the Melanoma Program at the<lb/> Angeles Clinic in Santa Monica, California.<lb/> &quot;The data from the SYMMETRY trial presented at the Perspectives in Melanoma XIII Conference shows<lb/> an important connection between patients&apos; baseline level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), an<lb/> established biomarker in melanoma, and treatment outcome with elesclomol,&quot; said Dr. O&apos;Day. &quot;Patients<lb/> with low and normal baseline levels of LDH showed an improvement in progression free survival (PFS),<lb/> the primary endpoint of the study. The OS (overall survival) data for these groups are still highly<lb/> censored and evolving; no difference has been observed to date between the treatment and control<lb/> arms. In contrast, patients with high baseline level of LDH showed no PFS benefit and a decreased<lb/> survival time relative to the control arm. These results, along with the results of other recent randomized<lb/> clinical trials, suggest that baseline LDH status may evolve from a prognostic factor for the disease to a<lb/> potentially predictive factor for treatment. This could pave the way for a more personalized approach to<lb/> treating this disease that considers markers such as LDH in determining an optimal approach to<lb/> therapy.&quot;<lb/> &quot;We believe there are three emerging findings from the SYMMETRY trial that are important for the future<lb/> of the elesclomol program,&quot; said Vojo Vukovic, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical<lb/> Officer, Synta Pharmaceuticals. &quot;First, there are clear signs of clinical benefit in the normal LDH<lb/> population. In this patient group, which represents 68% of the trial population, the PFS endpoint was<lb/> achieved. Second, any potential adverse effect on survival in favor of the control arm appears to be<lb/> restricted to the high LDH patient population. Finally, and importantly in considering development of<lb/> elesclomol beyond melanoma, there were no substantial differences in Grade 3 or 4 toxicities between<lb/> the two arms of the trial, consistent with safety findings from prior trials, indicating that elesclomol was<lb/> well tolerated.&quot;</div>
