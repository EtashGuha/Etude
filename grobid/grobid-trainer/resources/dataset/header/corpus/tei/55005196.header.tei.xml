			<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Mobile communication is a milestone technology that
				has brought people a kind of universal convenience otherwise<lb/> unattainable. From
				GSM to UMTS, the mobile communication technologies, like all the other great
				inventions in human<lb/> history, have gone through such fast-paced advancements
				since the very first day it came to existence that each day we<lb/> seem to be using
				a newer, more powerful device than before to talk to people close by or far away. We
				are so used to this<lb/> convenience that it is hard to imagine how life could carry
				on without cell phones. However, when cell phone users roam<lb/> from city to city
				crossing different system facilitators' domains of services, besides the conveyance
				of the signals, some<lb/> charging problems may also arise between or among the
				service providers. In this paper, we shall present a simple mobile<lb/>
				communication billing system that can help solve roaming-related charging problems.
				Our new system can be used in a<lb/> wide variety of applications without having to
				modify the standard UMTS protocol, and it only causes slight, readily<lb/> ignorable
				traffic increase. As we can expect, the new mobile communication billing system will
				be a friendly design that<lb/> comes in handy for both service providers and
				users.<lb/>
