	<div type="abstract">Protein distribution in each of two selections of Amaranthus caudatus, Amaranthus hypochondria-<lb/>cus, and Amaranthus cruentus was established by the Landry and Moreaux fractionation scheme.<lb/> Some of these fractions were analyzed for their amino acid content. Two extraction sequences were<lb/> used, which differed in the first solvent, water in one and 0.5 M NaCl in the other. No differences<lb/> were found in the protein fractions distribution between species or cultivars of the same species,<lb/> independent of the fractionation sequence used. The solvent sequence resulted in differences in frac-<lb/>tion I (albumin), 11 (globulin), I11 (prolamine), V (glutelin-like), and some in fraction VI (glutelins).<lb/> With water as first solvent, albumins averaged 20.7, globulins 19.2, prolamines 2.2, glutelins 44.4, with<lb/> 13.4% in the residue of the total protein. Albumins were rich in tryptophan, threonine, and lysine;<lb/> globulins in sulfur amino acids and lysine; prolamines in threonine and leucine; and glutelins in tryp-<lb/>tophan and leucine.<lb/></div>
	
	<div type="introduction"> Amaranth grain has been identified as a very promis-<lb/>ing food crop because of its exceptional nutritive value<lb/> as judged by its protein and lipid content, as well as for<lb/> its essential amino acid composition that has a relatively<lb/> high lysine content (Teotonico and Knorr, 1985). It is<lb/> of significance that cereals are deficient in lysine and tryp-<lb/>tophan in corn, lysine and threonine in rice (Deshpande<lb/> et al., 1955; Rosenberg et al., 1960), and lysine in wheat<lb/> (Howe et al., 1965), with adequate amounts of other essen-<lb/>tial amino acids. Amaranth protein amino acid content<lb/> closely approximates the amino acid pattern of the FAO/<lb/> WHO standard protein with the exception of leucine (Unit-<lb/>ed Nations University, 1980). Information on amino acid<lb/> content of individual proteins is very limited (Duarte-</div>
