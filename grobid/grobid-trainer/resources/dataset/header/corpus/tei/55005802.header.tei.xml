	<div type="abstract">A method capable of measuring the activity of single enzyme molecules could<lb/> initiate studies of a number of biological problems not yet amenable to experimen-<lb/>tation. A technique for measuring f3-D-galactosidase in droplets of microscopic<lb/> size using a new fluorogenic substrate,-6-hydroxyfluoran-13-D-galactopyranoside<lb/> (6HFG) is described here. Results obtained by this technique indicate that it is<lb/> capable of detecting individual molecules of the enzyme.<lb/> As practical applications, the molecular weight and turnover number of f3-D-<lb/>galactosidase were determined by this method. The values obtained are compar-<lb/>able with those found by conventional techniques. Another application of this<lb/> method is in determining whether or not an enzyme is composed of a homogeneous<lb/> molecular species with respect to activity. This is exemplified here by experiments<lb/> with a genetically altered f3-D-galactosidase. We concluded that the altered<lb/> enzyme is a different species than normal f3-galactosidase. In contrast, thermal<lb/> inactivation leads to a mixture of fully-active and inactive enzyme molecules.<lb/> Materials and Methods.-The substrate 6HFG5 was synthesized by coupling 6-hydroxyfluoran<lb/> (6HF)1 and tetraacetyl-fD-galactopyranosylbromide2 in anhydrous benzene with silver oxide<lb/> present.3 The tetraacetyl galactoside was deacetylated with sodium methylate.4 The final<lb/> product, purified by ascendent paper chromatography in a 1-pentanol, 1-propanol, water system<lb/> (40:11:15), moved with an Rr of 0.17 on Whatman #1 paper at room temperature (220C). 6HF<lb/> was located by the strong greenish fluorescence of 6HF liberated after spraying a portion of the<lb/> paper with 6-D-galactosidase. A long wavelength &quot;Mineralight&quot; was used for excitation. UV<lb/> light of shorter wavelength decomposes 6HFG on paper, forming a compound with bluish fluo-<lb/>rescence. This can serve to locate 6HFG on chromatograms.<lb/> The purity of 6HFG was established by paper chromatography in three different solvent<lb/> systems at neutral, acid, and basic pH.5 Complete hydrolysis of 6HFG by a purified, crystalline<lb/> preparation of O-D-galactosidase from Escherichia coli (kindly supplied by Dr. D. Perrin) with</div>
