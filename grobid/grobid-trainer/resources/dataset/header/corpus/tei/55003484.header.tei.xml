	<div type="abstract">A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus<lb/> (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is<lb/> introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/<lb/> smoothing data containing a significant percentage of<lb/> gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications<lb/> in automated image analysis where interpretation is<lb/> based on the data provided by error-prone feature<lb/> detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the<lb/> application of RANSAC to the Location Determination<lb/> Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of<lb/> landmarks with known locations, determine that point<lb/> in space from which the image was obtained. In<lb/> response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are<lb/> derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed<lb/> to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for<lb/> computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed<lb/> form. These results provide the basis for an automatic<lb/> system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing<lb/></div>
