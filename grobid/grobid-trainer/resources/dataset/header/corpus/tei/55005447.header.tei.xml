	<div type="introduction">Base64 is a group of similar encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating<lb/> it into a radix-64 representation. The Base64 term originates from a specific MIME content transfer encoding.<lb/> Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs be stored<lb/> and transferred over media that are designed to deal with textual data. This is to ensure that the data remains<lb/> intact without modification during transport. Base64 is used commonly in a number of applications including<lb/> email via MIME, and storing complex data in XML.<lb/></div>
