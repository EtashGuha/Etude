	<div type="abstract">A b s T r A C T<lb/> Two outbreaks of Q fever were reported in the Netherlands<lb/> in 2007 and 2008. The ongoing 2008 outbreak in the<lb/> south-eastern part of the Netherlands is the largest<lb/> community outbreak ever described, with 808 cases<lb/> reported until August 2008. The changing epidemiology<lb/> of Q fever is most likely related to intensive goat farming,<lb/> and has important implications for the clinical care of<lb/> patients in endemic areas. Treatment of community-<lb/>acquired pneumonia has to take possible Q fever into<lb/> account, and the high incidence of Q fever endocarditis and<lb/> other manifestations of chronic Q fever require a specific<lb/> diagnostic and therapeutic approach.<lb/> </div>
	
	<div type="introduction">i N T r o d U C T i o N<lb/> In 2007, an outbreak of Q fever was reported in the<lb/> Netherlands, in particular around the town of Herpen.<lb/> In 2008, a remarkable further increase in Q fever cases<lb/> was noted around the city of Nijmegen, in the provinces<lb/> of Noord-Brabant and Gelderland, causing considerable<lb/> morbidity and a high number of hospital admissions. Until<lb/> 13 August 2008, 808 cases were notified, constituting the<lb/> largest community outbreak of Q fever reported in the<lb/> literature.<lb/></div>
