	<div type="abstract">Aims This study evaluates the feasibility and safety of a<lb/> completely implantable system for long-term ambulatory<lb/> monitoring of important haemodynamic parameters in<lb/> patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease.<lb/> Methods The design of the implantable monitoring system<lb/> is similar to a conventional single lead pacemaker. A lead<lb/> with incorporated biosensors for the continuous recording<lb/> of pressure and oxygen saturation signals is positioned<lb/> in the right ventricle and connected to a monitor and<lb/> memory device subcutaneously implanted like an ordinary<lb/> pacemaker can.<lb/> Results Five patients with implanted haemodynamic<lb/> monitoring systems have been followed for from 7 to 16<lb/> months. Continuous measurements of activity, heart rate,<lb/> mixed venous oxygen saturation and estimated pulmonary<lb/> artery diastolic pressure were registered with variable reso-<lb/>lution during daily living and predefined provocations. The<lb/> memory covered a maximum of 3 weeks at low resolution.<lb/> The monitored parameters showed an adequate and signifi-<lb/>cant response to various haemodynamic situations. Except<lb/> for the demand of recalibration of two oxygen sensors,<lb/> there were no technical problems and the quality of data<lb/> were excellent.<lb/> Conclusion Long-term ambulatory haemodynamic moni-<lb/>toring is feasible and potentially useful for the management<lb/> of patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease.<lb/></div>
