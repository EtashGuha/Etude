	<div type="abstract">Multivariate curve resolution – alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) has been applied to data collected from UV spectropho-<lb/> tometric analysis of melatonin samples exposed to light with varying irradiance power. MCR-ALS was able to explain the<lb/> degradation kinetics of this drug, deducing the pure spectra and concentration changes of the different species present<lb/> throughout the entire process. Possible rotational ambiguities associated with MCR solutions were investigated and their<lb/> extent was evaluated. The extent of the rotation ambiguity was estimated from the band boundaries of feasible solutions<lb/> calculated using the MCR-BANDS procedure. The use of a non-linear fitting routine allowed improving kinetic information and<lb/> provided a method of evaluation of the rate constants of the degradation process. The degradation pathway was found to<lb/> follow a first-order reaction model, in which melatonin underwent photo-oxidation of the indole ring to give a formylamine<lb/> group. Kinetics of the reaction was shown to be dependent on irradiation conditions, with an increase of the rate constants<lb/> when light power also increased. </div>
