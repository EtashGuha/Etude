	<div type="abstract">Abstract. The aim of this paper is to develop a<lb/> DGPS/MEMS INS integrated system, which is able to<lb/> provide a navigation solution with accuracy levels<lb/> appropriate for land vehicle navigation. The system<lb/> achieves this aim by augmenting the standard GPS/INS<lb/> Kalman filter with additional sensor error states, like scale<lb/> factor errors and sensor turn on biases, which prevent the<lb/> growth of errors in a stand-alone INS navigation solution,<lb/> to some extent. To achieve high accuracy positioning in<lb/> areas with restricted GPS coverage, the GPS and INS<lb/> sensors are integrated at the measurement level. Further,<lb/> to improve the accuracy of stand-alone INS during GPS<lb/> outages, the use of two vehicle dynamic constraints is<lb/> proposed. The goal is to derive observations from<lb/> constraint equations reflecting the behavior of a typical<lb/> land vehicle. The first constraint equation is derived<lb/> assuming the vehicle does not slip and always remains in<lb/> contact with the ground. If these assumptions are true the<lb/> velocity of the vehicle in the plane perpendicular to the<lb/> forward direction should be zero. The second constraint<lb/> equation is derived from the fact that the height does not<lb/> change much in a land vehicular environment. Thus,<lb/> when a GPS outage occurs, the integrated system uses a<lb/> complementary Kalman filter to combine the INS and<lb/> constraints-derived virtual measurements to keep the<lb/> position and velocity errors bounded. The obtained results<lb/> show that RMS horizontal accuracies of up to 6 m in the<lb/> position domain can be achieved, from the designed<lb/> DGPS/MEMS INS integrated system in a severely signal<lb/> degraded environment. With the proposed use of virtual<lb/> measurements obtained from vehicle motion constraints,<lb/> the accuracy improved by about 40% thereby constraining<lb/> the horizontal errors to less than the 4 m level.<lb/></div>
