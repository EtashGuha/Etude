			<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Flexible packages provide several advantages of
				lightweight, ease of storage, and deployment, and possibility of using<lb/>
				roll-to-roll coating in the manufacture. Of the flexible cells that can be used in
				flexible packages, organic solar cells are<lb/> very vulnerable to degradation under
				exposure to humidity, oxygen and other atmospheric gases, and CIGS and CdTe<lb/> are
				somewhat vulnerable. CIGS cell vulnerability to moisture and other atmospheric gases
				is being reduced by chemical<lb/> treatment. Multiple pairs of organic/inorganic
				layers termed dyad's that are being developed for providing protection to<lb/>
				considerably more vulnerable organic light emitting diodes are being tested
				successfully with CIGS flexible modules.<lb/> Multiple layers of extremely dense
				coatings prepared by atomic layer deposition that are being developed for
				providing<lb/> protection to organic light emitting diodes are also being tried with
				CIGS cells. It would be essential to reduce the<lb/> overall cost of individual or
				combined schemes for achieving economic viability.<lb/></div>
