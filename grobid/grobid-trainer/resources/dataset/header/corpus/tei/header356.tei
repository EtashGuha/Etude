		<div type="abstract">We first describe the general goals of system administration explaining the <lb/>relationship to monitoring, diagnosing, and repairing (MDR). Then, we describe the <lb/>functional and environmental concerns for a MDR system, and use these concerns to <lb/>explain how previous approaches have failed to fully address the problem. Next, we <lb/>describe the major pieces of our approach, and identify the research questions <lb/>associated with each piece. Finally we present a method for testing the system when <lb/>it is created. <lb/></div>
