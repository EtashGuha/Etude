			<div type="abstract">Proton spin-lattice relaxation rates have been measured at 30 MHz as a function of temperature <lb/>
for a large number of dimeric copper complexes with the ligands 8-hydroxyquinoIine, pyridine- <lb/>
N-oxide, methyl and dimethyl pyridine-N-oxide, and quinoline-N-oxide. Two carboxylates and <lb/>
adducts of several complexes with various solvents have also been studied. In contrast to some <lb/>
compounds with a normal magnetic behaviour, for most complexes a temperature dependent <lb/>
relaxation has been observed which agrees well with the concept of a weak antiferromagnetic <lb/>
interaction between the two Cu2+ ions. The singlet-triplet separations or exchange integrals have <lb/>
been determined. <lb/></div>
