			<div type="abstract">Abstract. One of the most important considerations in designing
				sensor nodes<lb/> in a wireless sensor networks is to extend the network lifetime by
				minimizing<lb/> an energy consumption with limited resources. In this paper, we
				propose an En-<lb/> ergy-Efficient Cluster Head Election (EECHE) algorithm in sensor
				networks<lb/> The proposed algorithm divides cluster area into two perpendicular
				diameters,<lb/> and then elects cluster head by the density of member nodes and the
				distance<lb/> from cluster head. Through the simulation experiments, we showed that
				our al-<lb/> gorithm has improves the performance of cluster head election and
				provides<lb/> more energy-efficient.<lb/></div>

				1 Introduction<lb/>
				A Sensor networks consist of large number of small, relatively inexpensive and low-<lb/>
				power sensors that are connected to the wireless network[1]. Since each node only has<lb/>
				limited energy resource and the battery recharge or replacement is impractical, sensor<lb/>
				networks with a energy-aware design becomes important to achieve the desired life-<lb/>
				time performance. The mean of energy-aware is that the energy spent on delivering<lb/>
				packets from a source to a destination is minimized [2].<lb/>
				Recently, various clustering technique to reduce an energy consumption of sensor<lb/>
				nodes have been developed. One of the most well-known clustering approaches is<lb/>
				LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) [3] a clustering-based protocol<lb/>
				that utilizes a randomized rotation of local cluster head to evenly distribute the energy<lb/>
				load among the sensors in the network. But LEACH can not have chance to cluster<lb/>
				head and consume their energy evenly with only probability. Unlike LEACH, where<lb/>
				nodes self-configure themselves into clusters, LEACH-C (LEACH-Centralized) [4]<lb/>
				utilizes the base station for the cluster formation. But, at the beginning of each round,<lb/>
				LEACH-C causes on additional overhead to receive information from each node<lb/>
