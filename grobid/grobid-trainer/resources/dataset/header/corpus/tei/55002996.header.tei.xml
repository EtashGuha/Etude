	<div type="introduction">In the last time thc number of research works dealing with preservation of vegetables increased<lb/> again [ 11. The interest is directed to the production of lactic acid fermented vegetable juices. By lactic-acid<lb/> fermentation there are yielded extraordinarily delicious and consistent products owing high nutritive-<lb/>physiological value. At production, there is applied either spontaneous fermentation, or controlled<lb/> inoculation using selected and proved microorganisms cultures [2, 31. The producers demand such<lb/> fermentation cultures which intensify the aroma and enable to reach rapid decrease ofjuices&apos; pH value.<lb/> At lactic-acid fermentation the production of lactic acid is regarded as crucial factor for preservation.<lb/> With regard to accessibility of vegetables and their favourable chemical composition for microorganisms<lb/> we began fermentation experiments with various kinds of vegetables as carrot, green pea, celeriac,<lb/> onion, capsicum and cabbage.<lb/> In this paper, we publish on fcrmentation of green pea and onion, reporting on production and<lb/> amount of organic acids in fermented vegetables determined using isotachophoresis.<lb/> Materials and methods<lb/> Fermentation ojgreen pea. In experiments there was used frozen and stored green pea. After having<lb/> de-freezed thc samples and having performed the primary analysis (determination of reducing sugars,<lb/> titritable acids, pH) the brine with demanded salt and reducing sugars was prepared. For samples<lb/> designed PI -P3 the brine contained 1.5% NaCl and 2.4% reducing sugars; the blend of pea and<lb/> brine was 5:4. For samples designed P4-P7 the concentration of reducing sugars was modified to<lb/> 3.57% and the brine contained 1.5% NaC1.<lb/> Fermentation .f&apos; onion. The onions were cleaned before fermentation and cut to small pieces. The<lb/> onions were dosed 2: 3 (onion: brine). The brine had 1.5% NaCl and the concentration of reducing<lb/> sugars was 3.18%.<lb/> Fermentation was performed at 23 &quot;C during 7 days. At fermentation the following microorganisms<lb/> were used 1 Pediocorcus sp. &quot;CSL&quot;, Pediococcus acidibctici, Lactobacillus sp. &quot;S&quot;, Lactobacillus sp.<lb/> ,,U&quot;, Lactohucillusfi.r~ientum.<lb/> In prepared samples we determined organic acids using isotachophoresis. Measurements were made<lb/> on CS Isotachophoretic Analyser ZKI 0 1 (Spiiska N. Ves, CSFR) with a conductivity detector and a<lb/> double line recorder T Z 4200. For identification and determination an electrolytic system of following<lb/> composition was applied: concentration of leading electrolyte 1 . lo-&apos; M HCL; counter ion E-<lb/>aminocaproic acid, pH 4.5; additive MHEC (methylhydroxyethylcellulose) 0.1 % ; terminating elec-<lb/>trolyte 5 .<lb/> M histidine, pH 4-5. The samples were analysed at a driving<lb/> current of 200 pA in the preseparation column and 50 pA in the analytical column. Quantitative<lb/> analysis was performed using the calibration curve method.<lb/> M caproic acid; 5 .<lb/> Results and discussion<lb/> There was proved, that the green pea. despite of its composition is able to be prcserved by lactic-acid<lb/> fermentation after having chosen the suitable microorganism strain, but there is requircmcnt of good<lb/> </div>

At having reached approximately 4% of reducing<lb/> sugars in the whole fermented amount, the production of lactic acid was improved. The pea had an<lb/> agreeable sour taste without strange odour. In Table 1 are presented analysed pea samples, applied<lb/> microorganisms and mean contents of determined organic acids. The mean values of organic acids<lb/> content were calculated from three measurements. From Table 1 follows, that in fermented samples<lb/> only lactic and acetic acids were present. The highest content of lactic acid showed the samples P6,<lb/> then PI. The highest content of acetic acid had sample P5.</div>
