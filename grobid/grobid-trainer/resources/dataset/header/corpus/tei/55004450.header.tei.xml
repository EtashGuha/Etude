	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Governments around the world continue to search for new pieces of<lb/> radio spectrum which can be used by the expanding wireless<lb/> communications industry to provide Broadband Wireless Access (BWA).<lb/> The concept of allowing secondary or unlicensed transmissions in<lb/> frequencies occupied by a primary or licensed user is a technique to<lb/> &quot;unlock&quot; existing spectrum for new use. An obvious requirement is<lb/> that these secondary or unlicensed transmissions do not interfere<lb/> with the primary or licensed use of the spectrum. The fundamental<lb/> issue is how to determine for a specific location and specific time<lb/> if any TV channels are available for unlicensed use, e.g. they are<lb/> not being used for TV broadcast or by a wireless microphone.<lb/> Academia and Industry have studied multiple cognitive radio enablers<lb/> for use in such a scenario. The methods of geolocation and database<lb/> have been shown to achieve favorable results. This document<lb/> discusses the requirements and the problems that need to be addressed<lb/> for enabling the use of white-space spectrum by obtaining information<lb/> from a database.<lb/></div>
