		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Binary manipulators are powered by actuators <lb/>which have only two stable states. Therefore, they <lb/>can reach only a discrete (but possibly large) number <lb/>of locations. Compared to a manipulator built with <lb/>continuous actuators, a binary manipulator provides <lb/>reasonable performance, and is relatively inexpensive <lb/>(up to an order of magnitude cheaper). The number <lb/>of states of a binary manipulator grows exponentially <lb/>with the number of actuators. This makes the calculation of its inverse kinematics quite difficult. This <lb/>paper presents a combinatorial method for computing <lb/>the inverse kinematics of a binary manipulator that <lb/>reduces the search space to a manageable size. It also <lb/>creates extremely smooth motions that follow a specified trajectory very accurately (in both position and <lb/>orientation), despite the discrete nature of binary actuation. <lb/></div>
