	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Cordyceps sinensis, an entomogenous fungus used in traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits very broad biological and pharmacologi-<lb/>cal actions in hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, and immunologic systems as well as anticancer activity. Pharmacological functions of<lb/> Cordyceps are primarily due to the bioactive polysaccharides, modified nucleosides, and cyclosporin-like metabolites produced by this<lb/> fungus and related species. The beneficial effects on renal and hepatic function and immunomodulation-related antitumor activities are<lb/> most promising and deserve great attention. Many previous studies used fruiting bodies, but recently an increasing number of studies have<lb/> used cultured mycelia in investigations. It is difficult to determine if the same bioactive ingredients exist in fruiting bodies and cultured<lb/> mycelia and contribute to the pharmacological actions reported in the literature. More mechanism-based, disease-oriented pharmacologi-<lb/>cal studies are required to ensure clinical efficacy for particular diseases. Adjuvant therapy using C. sinensis for immune function distur-<lb/>bances, cancer, and renal failure is possible if double-blind, randomized placebo-control clinical studies show the efficacy of this herb.<lb/></div>
