		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In recent years, networks with media rates of 100 Mbit/second or more have become widely available (FDDI, ATM, <lb/>HIPPI, ..). However, many computer systems cannot make use of the available bandwidth because of the high <lb/>overhead associated with network communication. In this paper we review the operations involved in communication over high-speed networks, and we describe optimizations of the network interface that improve network <lb/>throughput. We also discuss how the payoff of the optimizations is influenced by features of the host software and <lb/>architecture. This paper is based on our experience with the interfaces for the Nectar and Gigabit Nectar networks. <lb/></div>
