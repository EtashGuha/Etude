		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Fast networks have made it possible to coordinate distributed heterogeneous CPU, <lb/>memory and storage resources to provide a powerful platform for executing high-performance applications. However, the performance of parallel applications on such <lb/>systems is highly dependent on the mapping of application tasks to machines. In this <lb/>paper, we propose a mapping strategy for applications formed by multiple tasks targeted <lb/>to heterogeneous platforms. We first define a mapping model, the match-tree, which <lb/>reects the data movement and conversion costs of distributed algorithms and allows for <lb/>alternative implementations of individual tasks on different machines. We then define the <lb/>find-mapping and split-partition algorithms, based on the match-tree model, to <lb/>determine the best allocation of tasks to resources in heterogeneous systems. We <lb/>illustrate the use of these algorithms with a sample distributed application. <lb/></div>
