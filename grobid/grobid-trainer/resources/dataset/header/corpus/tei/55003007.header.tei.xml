	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT There are many network transport and application layer protocols that have been developed<lb/> and designed for the delivery of time-sensitive and critical data over best-effort Ethernet<lb/> networks. Choosing the appropriate protocols is crucial to ensuring the performance of the<lb/> network for data transmission. Network layer protocols, such as TCP/IP or UDP/IP,<lb/> determine the reliability of the data transmission while application layer protocols are<lb/> designed to enhance the services of the underlying transport protocol. This paper will<lb/> compare the Quality of Service (QoS) tradeoffs for both UDP and TCP. In this paper it is<lb/> shown that UDP or TCP alone is insufficient to meet the transmission requirements of<lb/> telemetry data and to overcome these limitations, an application layer protocol is required to<lb/> enhance the delivery of real-time sensitive data. This paper presents the Real-time Transport<lb/> Protocol (RTP) and proposes a RTP telemetry profile payload definition that provides<lb/> complete payload self-description and up to 98% packetization efficiency.<lb/></div>
