		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We simulate a multiagent market with production, consumption, and exchange <lb/>mediated by a sealed-bid double auction. Marked price bubbles and subsequent <lb/>crashes occur when value-based (fundamentals-driven) and trend-based traders are <lb/>both present, and the market equilibrium price is ramped up exogenously. Similarly, <lb/>negative price bubbles and recoveries occur when the equilibrium price is ramped <lb/>down. Because the simulated market is auction-mediated, we can observe the operations of traders during these events, and study the interactions that produce and <lb/>resolve bubbles. Some preliminary circuit-breaker experiments are described, in which <lb/>bubbles are interrupted during their formation. <lb/></div>
