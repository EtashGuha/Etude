	<div type="abstract">Abstract—Dual-energy imaging is based on the acquisition of<lb/> two spectrally distinct attenuation measurements. The two most<lb/> common techniques are the dual-kV technique and the dual-<lb/>detector layer technique. More recently, another technique was<lb/> introduced based on the simultaneous acquisition of photon-<lb/>counting and current integration data (CIX) by means of a<lb/> dedicated detector readout ASIC. All of the above methods have<lb/> certain advantages and disadvantages. While depending on the<lb/> particular realization (e.g., kVp switching, dual-tube systems<lb/> in computed tomography), the dual-kV technique suffers from<lb/> a time-lag between the two acquisitions and as a result from<lb/> susceptibility to motion. The dual-layer technique usually offers<lb/> less spectral separation and requires a dedicated detection system.<lb/> The CIX technique suffers from a reduced dynamic range due<lb/> to the limiting rate performance in the counting channel. In this<lb/> paper we introduce yet another dual-energy technique, similar<lb/> to the CIX, however, without the restrictions coming from the<lb/> limited count rate. We propose dual-energy imaging based on<lb/> simultaneous acquisition of the mean (DC) and variance (AC)<lb/> components of the electrical detector signal, i.e., simultaneous<lb/> integration-mode readout and Campbell-mode readout (fluctu-<lb/>ation mode). The method is based on &quot;Campbell&apos;s theorem&quot;<lb/> which states that the variance of the deviations from the mean<lb/> detector signal is proportional to the second moment of the<lb/> incoming x-ray energy spectrum. We compare in simulations the<lb/> dual-energy performance of the proposed new technique with<lb/> conventional dual-kV and dual-crystal techniques and present<lb/> first experimental Campbell-mode CT images obtained from a<lb/> scintillator crystal coupled to a photomultiplier tube. Moreover,<lb/> we demonstrate the feasibility of separating iodine from calcium<lb/> with the novel technique and compare it to the separability<lb/> achieved with a dual-kV technique.<lb/></div>
