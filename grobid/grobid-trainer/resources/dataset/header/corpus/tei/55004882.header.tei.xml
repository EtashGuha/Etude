	<div type="abstract">of the red emission remains a problem.<lb/> Conclusions Europium-doped alkaline-earth oxyhalides and the pure<lb/> compounds Eu40C1, and EU40Br6 show efficient blue<lb/> emission under excitation with UV and X-rays. Because<lb/> the excitation and emission spectra of all these compounds<lb/> are similar, it is concluded that the luminescence properties<lb/> of Eu2+ in this structure are mainly governed by the oxide<lb/> anion in the [M,O] tetrahedron, although some influence<lb/> of the halide is observed. Due to a relatively small spectral<lb/> overlap there is no concentration quenching in Eu40C16<lb/> and EU4OBr6. In the alkaline-earth oxyhalides the Pb2+<lb/> ion shows emission in the blue. In addition to this emission<lb/> there is a broad, strongly Stokes-shifted red emission, the<lb/> nature of which remains obscure.<lb/> Acknowledgment. We thank M. P. B. van Bruggen,<lb/> M. M. R. Jeurissen, and S. J. H. M. Kluijtmans for per-</div>
