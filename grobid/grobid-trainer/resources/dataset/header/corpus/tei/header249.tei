		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Three dimensional visualisation has become a <lb/>widespread scheme for helping users to access <lb/>and manage large information network. In this <lb/>report, various techniques for displaying depth <lb/>information are reviewed, with an emphasis on <lb/>stereoscopic displays. Input devices used to interact with a 3-D space are also examined. Issues in 3-D network visualisation are elicited from <lb/>three viewpoints: psychological, task-related and <lb/>implementational. Consideration of these issues <lb/>leads to the design of a preliminary experimental <lb/>programme for evaluating various network visu-alisation techniques. <lb/></div>
