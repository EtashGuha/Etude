	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The complex issue of occupant safety in buildings during emergencies has been the subject of<lb/> debate amongst enforcing authorities, building owners, emergency personnel and code bodies<lb/> for many years. The tragic events of September 11<lb/> th 2001 have added to the urgency for<lb/> developing solutions that will enhance occupant safety.<lb/> The elevators are the primary means of vertical transportation in most buildings and potentially<lb/> can play a vital role in the event of an emergency. The dominant practice around the world,<lb/> however, is to discourage the use of elevators by the public during these emergencies, except<lb/> when the elevator is under the control of qualified emergency workers, such as firefighters. The<lb/> major reason for this practice is the unpredictability of the emergency (e.g., fire) and the added<lb/> danger of entrapping passengers in the elevators due to the emergency condition.<lb/> As part of a broad safety evaluation by all stakeholders in the building industry, the elevator<lb/> segment is exploring the potential for enhancing the role of elevators in emergency<lb/> circumstances.</div>
