	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The Internet&apos;s architecture largely and implicitly assumes<lb/> full-time connectivity, a notion that is embodied in key<lb/> networking principles including fate sharing, soft state,<lb/> and the end-to-end principle. In contrast, efforts to allow<lb/> for more graceful operation in the presence of forced dis-<lb/>connectedness have recently been undertaken that change<lb/> the underlying style of networking used by applications<lb/> to accommodate both host-level and hop-by-hop discon-<lb/>nectedness (e.g., for deep space networks where connec-<lb/>tivity depends on orbital mechanics). In this paper, we<lb/> offer an initial exploration of the architectural constructs<lb/> required to support selective connectivity, whereby a host<lb/> can choose whether to be &quot;connected&quot; or &quot;disconnected&quot;.<lb/> While we keep our notion of selective connectivity gen-<lb/>eral, the driver behind our thinking is to allow hosts to<lb/> go to sleep to realize energy savings while not sacrific-<lb/>ing their standing in the network. Studies show that en-<lb/>abling such sleeping offers large potential energy savings.<lb/> Specifically, we explore ideas related to assistants, soft<lb/> state, host-based control, and application primitives.<lb/></div>
