	<div type="introduction">Description<lb/> Xrdb is used to get or set the contents of the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of<lb/> screen 0, or the SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of any or all screens, or everything<lb/> combined. You would normally run this program from your X startup file.<lb/> Most X clients use the RESOURCE_MANAGER and SCREEN_RESOURCES properties to get user<lb/> preferences about color, fonts, and so on for applications. Having this information in the server (where it<lb/> is available to all clients) instead of on disk, solves the problem in previous versions of X that required you<lb/> to maintain defaults files on every machine that you might use. It also allows for dynamic changing of<lb/> defaults without editing files.<lb/> The RESOURCE_MANAGER property is used for resources that apply to all screens of the display. The<lb/> SCREEN_RESOURCES property on each screen specifies additional (or overriding) resources to be used<lb/> for that screen. (When there is only one screen, SCREEN_RESOURCES is normally not used, all<lb/> resources are just placed in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.)<lb/> The file specified by filename (or the contents from standard input if -or no filename is given) is<lb/> optionally passed through the C preprocessor with the following symbols defined, based on the capabilities<lb/> of the server being used:</div>
