		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>VBR compressed video is known to exhibit significant, multiple- <lb/>time-scale bit rate variability. In this paper, we consider the transmission of stored video from a server to a client across a high speed <lb/>network, and explore how the client buffer space can be used most <lb/>effectively toward reducing the variability of the transmitted bit <lb/>rate. <lb/>We present two basic results. First, we present an optimal <lb/>smoothing algorithm for achieving the greatest possible reduction <lb/>in rate variability when transmitting stored video to a client with <lb/>given buffer size. We provide a formal proof of optimality, and <lb/>demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on a set of long <lb/>MPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impact <lb/>of optimal smoothing on the network resources needed for video <lb/>transport, under two network service models: Deterministic Guar- <lb/>anteed service [1, 11] and Renegotiated CBR (RCBR) service [9, 8]. <lb/>Under both models, we find the impact of optimal smoothing to be <lb/>dramatic. <lb/></div>
