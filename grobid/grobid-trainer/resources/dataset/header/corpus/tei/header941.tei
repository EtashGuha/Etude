		<div type="abstract">Abstract: <lb/> Classical methods for parallel text alignment consider one specific level (e.g. <lb/> sentences) along which two or more versions of a text are to be synchronised. This <lb/> may lead to some problems when these documents are particularly long since <lb/> alignment errors at some point in the text may, in the absence of any other <lb/> linguistic information, propagate for some time without any chance of recovery. In <lb/> this chapter we consider how multilingual parallel alignment can be based on the <lb/> fact that more and more texts are now highly structured by means of tagging <lb/> languages such as SGML. In particular we will describe recent efforts in multi- <lb/> level alignment for which we will present the main advances as well as some of the <lb/> difficulties to be dealt with, in particular when the text and its translation are <lb/> associated with different encoding schemes or different encoding practices for the <lb/> same scheme. <lb/></div>
