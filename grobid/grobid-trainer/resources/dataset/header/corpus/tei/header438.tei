		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Applications of learning to autonomous <lb/>agents (simulated or real) have often been <lb/>restricted to learning a mapping from perceived state of the world to the next action <lb/>to take. Often this is couched in terms of <lb/>learning from no previous knowledge. This <lb/>general case for real autonomous robots is <lb/>very difficult. In any case, when building a <lb/>real robot there is usually a lot of a priori <lb/>knowledge (e.g., from the engineering that <lb/>went into its design) which doesn&apos;t need to <lb/>be learned. We describe the behavior-based <lb/>approach to autonomous robots, and then examine four classes of learning problems associated with such robots. <lb/></div>
