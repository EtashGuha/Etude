		<div type="abstract">Abstract. Traditional decision theory has assumed that agents have complete, consistent and readily available beliefs and preferences. Obviously, even if <lb/>an expert system has complete and consistent beliefs, it cannot have them readily <lb/>available. Moreover, some beliefs about beliefs are not even approximately computable. It is shown that if all players have complete and consistent beliefs, they <lb/>can compute approximate beliefs about beliefs of any order by considering events <lb/>arbitrarily close in some well-defined sense to the ones in question. <lb/></div>
