	</docTitle>

	<div type="abstract">Description<lb/> ACRYSOL RM-825 is a non-ionic urethane rheology modifier, designed for formulating interior/exterior paints<lb/> ranging from highly structured to paints that portray nearly Newtonian behaviour.<lb/> ACRYSOL RM-825 rheology modifier shows a very good balance of low and high shear viscosity. The nature of this<lb/> balance is dependent on formulations and latex types as described in later sections of this document. This allows<lb/> the formulation of paints meeting a variety of rheological requirements.<lb/> ACRYSOL RM-825 can be used as a co-thickener in many types of formulations for attaining a desired balance of<lb/> low and high shear viscosities. It has excellent water and alkali resistance.<lb/> Characteristics<lb/> z Good film build, better hiding with brush and roller<lb/> z Resistant to microbial attack<lb/> z Excellent water and alkali resistance<lb/> z Excellent spatter resistance<lb/> z Use over a wide pH range<lb/> z Ease of handling<lb/> Formulations<lb/> Formulations Guidelines<lb/> Incorporation<lb/> ACRYSOL RM-825 rheology modifier is supplied as a pourable and pumpable liquid and should not need dilution. It<lb/> can be added to the grind or during letdown. Addition to the grind, prior to dispersing, can accelerate the rate of<lb/> viscosity equilibration.<lb/> The viscosity of ACRYSOL RM-825 increases at lower temperatures. Therefore, if the product has been stored at<lb/> low temperature, it should be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature before use in order to facilitate handling.<lb/></div>
