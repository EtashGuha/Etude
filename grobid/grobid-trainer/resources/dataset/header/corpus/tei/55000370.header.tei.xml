However, it was noted that altera<lb/> tion of the filter parameters from those determined<lb/> from the phantom studies was required to obtain the<lb/> most visually pleasing images for organ systems (ob<lb/> jects) which were quite different from the liver and<lb/> spleen studies for which the filter was optimized.<lb/> This paper describes a method which uses interactive<lb/> visual feedback (7-9) to allow an operator to select<lb/> from among a family of â€oeoptimalâ€@BULLET Metz filters (i.e.,<lb/> those designed for a particular MTF) the filter best<lb/> suited for the image being processed (i.e., object imaged<lb/> and noise level). The visual feedback comes from two<lb/> sources. The first is the viewer&apos;s subjective impression<lb/> of image quality (7-9).

In an effort<lb/> to providesubjectivelyoptimalfiltering,a programhas been developedwhichprovidesTMreal<lb/> timeâ€@BULLET visual feedback. This allows a user to select from among a family of Metz filters tailored<lb/> for the imaging conditions (i.e., formed to deconvolve scatter, septal penetration, and<lb/> combined collimator and intrinsic spatial resolution ksses). @Jso, a guideline for assisting the<lb/> userin selectingfrom amongthe possibleMetzfiftershas beenformulated.Thisguidelineis<lb/> based upon knov@4edge of the probability distribution of the noise power spectrum, and<lb/> consistsof choosingthe filter whichhasa valueof 1.0 whenthe one-dimensional<lb/> compressionof the imagepower spectrumequalsthe 90% confidencelimitfor noise<lb/> fluctuations.
