	<div type="abstract">A study was conducted to investigate the cyclic oxidation behavior of two oxide dispersion strengthened<lb/> (ODS) Fe-Cr-Al based alloys containing 0.17 wt.% and 0.7 wt.% Y 2 O 3 . The alloys were oxidized in air for<lb/> 100 h at 1200 °C based on a 24 h cycle period. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and analytical transmission electron<lb/> microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the structure, morphology, and composition of the oxide<lb/> scales. Both alloys formed highly adherent and continuous layers of ␣-Al 2 O 3 exhibiting a morphology<lb/> indicative of inward scale growth. The role of Y 2 O 3 was to promote adherence by segregating to the grain<lb/> boundaries within the oxide. Concurrently, Y 2 O 3 generated micro-porosity resulting in a scale of com-<lb/>paratively higher thickness in the alloy with 0.7 wt.% Y 2 O 3 .<lb/></div>
