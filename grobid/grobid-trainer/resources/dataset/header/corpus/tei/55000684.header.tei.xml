	<div type="abstract">Description The non-toxic monomer, vinylformamide, is polymerized<lb/> and then hydrolyzed to form Lupamin 9095, a linear high<lb/> molecular weight polyvinylamine that is a colorless to<lb/> yellow water solution. It is greater than 90% hydrolyzed.</div>
	
	<div type="introduction"><lb/> Applications Polyvinylamine is only commercially available from BASF.<lb/> Lupamin is the highest molecular weight commercially<lb/> available, linear, cationic polymer. It is pH sensitive with a<lb/> cationic charge as high as 19 meq/g polymer. On a<lb/> cellulose surface the Zeta Potential varies from –10 to 90<lb/> mV. Lupamin can be used in waste treatment, particularly<lb/> when it is combined with polyacrylamide. It can increase<lb/> the solids in the waste. Other applications are adhesives,<lb/> packaging, personal care, textiles and corrosion inhibition.<lb/> Lupamin is a registered trademark of BASF Aktiengesellschaft.<lb/> For More Information<lb/> Order Placement<lb/> To place orders for delivery in the United States please call our toll free number (800) 443-6460.
