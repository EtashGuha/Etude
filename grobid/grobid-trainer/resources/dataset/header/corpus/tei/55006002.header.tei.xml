	<div type="abstract">SUMMARY Many people who are allergic to birch pollen are also allergic to apple fruit, due to cross-allergenicity. Since apples<lb/> are the most extensively consumed fruit in Europe, it is highly relevant to develop a hypo-allergenic apple. Apples with<lb/> significantly reduced levels of the allergen, Mal d 1, may allow many apple allergics to eat them without an allergic<lb/> reaction. We are currently collaborating to develop a hypo-allergenic apple within the European Integrated Research<lb/> Project, ISAFRUIT (www.isafruit.org). Hypo-allergenic apple plants (Malus Ï« domestica Borkh., &apos;Elstar&apos;) with<lb/> decreased levels of Mal d 1 mRNA were produced by RNA interference (RNAi) technology. Ten genetically modified<lb/> (GM) apple lines were selected. In vitro plantlets were first transferred to a greenhouse, then grafted onto wild-type<lb/> M.9 rootstock to promote the development of fruit-producing trees. Levels of Mal d 1 gene silencing were measured<lb/> repeatedly by quantitative real-time PCR. Compared to leaf samples from wild-type &apos;Elstar&apos;, two GM lines showed<lb/> modest levels of gene silencing (up to 250-fold), whereas the other eight GM lines were significantly silenced (up<lb/> to10,000-fold) in Mal d 1 gene expression. These levels of silencing were unaffected by grafting, and have been stable<lb/> over more than 3 years, and throughout all developmental stages.<lb/></div>
