	<div type="abstract">AbstractÐThis paper describes the structure±activity relationships of a new class of cytomegalovirus DNA polymerase inhibitors<lb/> having two aryl groups joined by an acyloxyamidine linker. Examination of a series of analogues in which the terminal groups are<lb/> varied revealed a very narrow SAR around the 2,4-dichlorophenyl group of the lead compound, but a variety of replacements for<lb/> the benzothiazole ring are compatible with activity. The most notable of these is the isoxazole ring of compound 78, which provides<lb/> a 30-fold enhancement in potency compared to the lead compound. We also describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of 10<lb/> analogues in which the acyloxyamidine linker is modi®ed or replaced by an isosteric group. Structure±activity relationship studies<lb/> identi®ed the linker -NH 2 group as a critical pharmacophoric element. Ab initio molecular orbital calculations combined with<lb/> qualitative estimates of steric interaction energies suggest that the lowest energy conformations of the acyloxyamidine linker are<lb/> characterized by an extended planar C Ar ±C=N±O±C arrangement and either a syn-periplanar or anti-periplanar N±O±C±C Ar<lb/> H<lb/> arrangement. Only the anti-periplanar conformation was observed in the crystal structures of three acyloxyamidines. The most<lb/> active of the linker-modi®ed compounds designed on the basis of these studies is the amidine carbamate 20, which is approximately<lb/> one-third as potent in the cytomegalovirus DNA polymerase inhibition assay as the comparator acyloxyamidine 53. The activity of<lb/> 20 suggests that acyloxyamidines may bind to the cytomegalovirus DNA polymerase via an anti-periplanar conformation similar to<lb/> that observed in the crystal structure of acyloxyamidine 36.</div>
