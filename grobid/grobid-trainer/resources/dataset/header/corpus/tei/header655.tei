		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>People display regularities in almost everything they do. This <lb/>paper proposes characteristics of an idealized algorithm that, <lb/>when applied to sequences of user actions, would allow a user <lb/>interface to adapt over time to an individual&apos;s pattern of use. <lb/>We describe a simple predictive method with these characteristics and show its predictive accuracy on a large dataset of <lb/>UNIX commands to be at least as good as others that have <lb/>been considered, while using fewer computational and memory resources. <lb/></div>
