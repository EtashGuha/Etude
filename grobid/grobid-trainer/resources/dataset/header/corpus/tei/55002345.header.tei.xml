	<div type="abstract">Solid-phase extraction using strong anion exchange disks was evaluated as an alternative extraction<lb/> method to conventional liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) for the quantitative analysis of the herbicide<lb/> Dacthal (DCPA) and its mono-and dicarboxylic acid metabolites in ground water. The average<lb/> recoveries of DCPA and its acid metabolites from deionized water were 93.7 &amp; 2.6% and 85.6 f<lb/> 2.5%, respectively. The detection limit of the SAX disk method is 0.05 pg/L for a 100 mL water<lb/> sample. While no DCPA was detected in ground water from the Malheur River Basin in eastern<lb/> Oregon, the total concentrations of the acid metabolites of DCPA in 100 mL samples of ground<lb/> water ranged from less than the detection limit (0.05<lb/> to 158.2 pg/L and were in good agreement<lb/> with those determined by means of conventional LLE.<lb/></div>
