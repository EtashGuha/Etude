	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease and the diagnosis of its idiopathic form remains challenging.<lb/> The diagnosis of idiopathic form is based on clinical features which can have poor sensitivity with about 25% of patients<lb/> diagnosed as having the disease actually having other conditions. In this study we assess the suitability and clinical value of<lb/> a low cost computer-based system as an aid to diagnosis of PD, in particular the presence of tremor. All participants (12<lb/> patients and 10 controls) performed a shape-tracing task using a graphic tablet attached to a laptop. To assess the presence<lb/> of tremors in the collected data, a statistical spectral analysis of the moment-to-moment fluctuations in the position signal<lb/> of the output from the digitising tablet was performed. This allowed the comparison of power spectrums obtained from<lb/> the control and patient responses respectively. A peak in log power between the 5Hz &amp; 6Hz can clearly be identified in the<lb/> patient&apos;s spectrum and is indicative of Parkinson&apos;s related tremor and no similar peak could be seen in the control&apos;s spectrum,<lb/> suggesting this type of sequential task and automated data analysis may be useful in the diagnosis of tremor.<lb/></div>
