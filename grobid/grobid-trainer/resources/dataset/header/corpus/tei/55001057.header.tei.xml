	<div type="abstract">O-Linked glycans were isolated from human skim milk mucins or mucin-derived high-<lb/>molecular weight glycopeptides and fractionated by anion exchange chromatography into<lb/> neutral and acidic alditols. Major oligosaccharides contained in the acidic fraction were<lb/> purified by high performance liquid chromatography and structurally characterized by a<lb/> combination of fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, methylation analysis and 500<lb/> MHz 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structural aspects exhibited by<lb/> these major species in the acidic fraction resemble those established previously for the<lb/> neutral oligosaccharides from human skim milk mucins:<lb/> 1) the size of the alditols varies from tri-to decasaccharides,<lb/> 2) the core structure is of the ubiquitous type 2,<lb/> 3) the backbone sequences are of the poly-N-acetyllactosamine type with a particular<lb/> preponderance of linearly extended GIcNAc[3(1-3)Gal (major) or GIcNAc[3(1-6)Gal units<lb/> (minor).<lb/> N-Acetylneuraminic acid on monosialylated (mucin-or glycopeptide-derived) and<lb/> disialylated glycans (glycopeptide derived) is linked predominantly to position C-3 of<lb/> galactose.<lb/></div>
<div type= "introduction"> Mucins are high molecular weight glycoproteins, which represent the major components of<lb/> mucus, the visco-elastic glycocalyx lining the surfaces of glandular epithelial tissues. The<lb/> clustered carbohydrate chains of mucins (up to 200 per monomeric unit) are linked O-<lb/>glycosidically to the peptide core and exhibit a high degree of structural diversity. According<lb/> to this particular property mucins as fo6nd in human serum and secretions or in epithelial<lb/> membranes are suitable candidates as tumor diagnostic markers since they may readily<lb/> indicate differentiation-related variations of the glycosylation status on normal vs. malignant<lb/> cel Is. Not surprisingly, since introduction of the hybridoma technique numerous monoclonal<lb/> antibodies have been generated and shown to define cancer-associated mucin epitopes [1-<lb/>4]. Hybridoma-defined mucins are regular components of human milk precipitating with the<lb/> *Author for correspondence.<lb/> 525</div>
