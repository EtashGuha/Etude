	<div type="abstract">Alzheimer&apos;s Disease (AD) is described as a degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by a<lb/> noticeable cognitive decline defined by a loss of memory and learning ability, together with a reduced ability to perform<lb/> basic activities of daily living. In the brain of an AD patients is the dramatic decrease in cholinergic innervation in the cortex<lb/> and hippocampus due to the loss of neurons in the basal forebrain. The above findings led to the development of the<lb/> cholinergic hypothesis, which proposes that the cognitive loss associated with AD is related to decreased cortical cholinergic<lb/> neurotransmission. In brain of Alzheimer&apos;s patient&apos;s one ascertained presence of neuritic plaques containing the beta-<lb/>amyloid peptide and protein tau. Biochemical and genetics studies implicated a central role for beta-amyloid in the<lb/> pathological cascade of events in AD.<lb/> The most therapeutic strategies in AD have been directed to two main targets: the beta-amyloid peptide and the<lb/> cholinergic neurotransmission. The first approach is to act on the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. The second<lb/> main approach is to slow of decline of neuronal degeneration or increasing cholinergic transmission.<lb/> Diagnosis of AD is very difficult and to date no specific diagnostic tests of the disease are available. Intellectual<lb/> function testing to determine the degree of cognitive status during routine medical examination is a useful supplementary<lb/> method of diagnosing dementia. The permissible result, come down from radiopharmacy, which is an integral part of a<lb/> nuclear medicine. A radiopharmaceutical may be defined as a pharmaceutical substance containing radioactive atoms.<lb/> Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are capable of mapping<lb/> the distribution of radionuclides in three dimensions, producing maps of brain biochemical and physiological processes. The<lb/> techniques are reasonably sensitive and specific in differentiating AD from other dementias.<lb/></div>

	<div type="introduction">Alzheimer&apos;s disease accounts for 50% of dementia-<lb/>type syndrome, characterized by organic disorders<lb/> related to cognitive functions. It is chronic<lb/> neurodegenerative pathology of the central nervous<lb/> system like Parkinson&apos;s and Huntigton&apos;s diseases,<lb/> exacerbating in the course of time.<lb/> The symptoms of Alzheimer&apos;s disease were first<lb/> described by Alois Alzheimer in 1907. It is<lb/> characterized by gradual and progressive worsening<lb/> of daily activities, behavioral and cognitive functions.<lb/> Approximately 8 years pass from the onset of disease<lb/> to death. Initially, a subtle decline in concentration<lb/> and memory is observed, the patient has to put more<lb/> effort in order to achieve the aim. These symptoms<lb/> are non specific and can also imitate stress,<lb/> exhaustion or appear as normal senile processes. That<lb/> is why they are often belittled. In next stages of the<lb/> disease symptoms include short-term memory loss<lb/> and impaired ability to perform instrumental activities<lb/> of daily living. Subsequently, blackouts appear, the<lb/> patient remembers issues from the past, but the person<lb/> does not recollect facts from yesterday, loses<lb/> orientation related to time and environment, and is not<lb/> able to make up straightforward decisions unaided. In<lb/> the advanced stage the patient has difficulties with<lb/> daily activities and does not control physiological<lb/> functions. In 5 years time the patient becomes<lb/> dependent on his/her caregivers<lb/> 1,2 . Consciousness<lb/> disorders and frequent mood fluctuations such as<lb/> apathy or agitation can be detected.<lb/> Alzheimer&apos;s disease is diagnosed in patients after<lb/> the age of 65. In the developed countries the<lb/> percentage of persons with Alzheimer&apos;s disease<lb/> between 65 and 70 years of age amounts to 2.5%,<lb/> approaching 25-30% in persons over the age of 85.<lb/> Globally, approximately 20 million persons suffer<lb/> from this pathology. It is a serious social and<lb/> economic problem, including direct costs of the<lb/> treatment and in addition costs 24 hr care in nursing</div>
