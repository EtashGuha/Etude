		<div type="abstract">Abstract: How do we formally specify the relation between a base class and a <lb/>derived class? This question has two parts, a syntactic one, and a semantic one. <lb/>The syntactic part is of course the easier of the two and the answer to that part is <lb/>the standard contra/co- variance requirement on the arguments and result of any <lb/>base class method redefined in the derived class. Our concern in the current paper <lb/>is with the semantic part of the question, i.e., how do we specify the behavioral <lb/>relation between the base class and the derived class? We show that the standard <lb/>answer -which is the semantic counterpart of contra/co-variance- is too rigid, and <lb/>does not allow some natural and common forms of inheritance. We then propose a <lb/>more flexible way to specify the relation, and show how different types of behavioral relations between base classes and derived classes may be specified using our <lb/>notation. <lb/></div>
