		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Many important scientific problems can be formulated as systems of ordinary differential equations with two-point boundary value constraints (BVODE). Multiple shooting <lb/>is one of the most widely used numerical techniques for solving BVODE problems. <lb/>In this work, we present a new distributed parallel numerical algorithm for BVODEs <lb/>which is based on multiple shooting. We investigate the numerical stability of this <lb/>new distributed algorithm and identify difficulties that can arise. We propose a new <lb/>parallel iterative refinement scheme to cope with some specific numerical difficulties <lb/>identified in our investigation. Computational experience is presented to demonstrate <lb/>the potential effectiveness of our approach. <lb/></div>
