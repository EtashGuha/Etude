		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The concept of a fitness formula as a property of an organism is proposed. In <lb/>artificial life simulations with organisms living in an environment, the fitness formula <lb/>can be interpreted as the ability of organisms to extract energy from potential food <lb/>sources distributed in the environment. In simulations where the goal of the genetic <lb/>algorithm is that of developing systems which exhibit a certain type of behavior in a <lb/>particular environment, the fitness formula becomes an independent variable which can <lb/>be manipulated in order to obtain the desired behavior. The fitness formula can be <lb/>viewed as an evolvable trait of organisms, and therefore not fixed and decided by the <lb/>researcher. Simulations with fixed and evolvable fitness formulae show that the fitness <lb/>formula, the sensory apparatus, and the behavior of organisms may co-evolve and be <lb/>co-adapted. <lb/></div>
