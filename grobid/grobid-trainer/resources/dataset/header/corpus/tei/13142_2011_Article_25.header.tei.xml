	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is developing a patient-<lb/>reported version of its Common Terminology Criteria for<lb/> Adverse Events, called the &quot; PRO-CTCAE. &quot; The PRO-CTCAE<lb/> consists of a library of patient-reported items which can be<lb/> administered in clinical trials to directly capture the patient<lb/> experience of adverse events during cancer treatment, as<lb/> well as a software platform for administering these items<lb/> via computer or telephone. In order to better understand<lb/> the impressions of stakeholders involved in cancer clinical<lb/> research about the potential value of the PRO-CTCAE<lb/> approach to capturing adverse event information in<lb/> clinical research, as well as their perspectives about<lb/> barriers and strategies for implementing the PRO-CTCAE in<lb/> NCI-sponsored cancer trials, a survey was conducted. A<lb/> survey including structured and open-ended questions<lb/> was developed to elicit perceptions about the use of<lb/> patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for adverse event<lb/> reporting, and to explore logistical considerations for<lb/> implementing the PRO-CTCAE in cancer trials. The survey<lb/> was distributed electronically and by paper to a<lb/> convenience sample of leadership and committee<lb/> members in the NCI&apos;s cooperative group network,<lb/> including principal investigators, clinical investigators,<lb/> research nurses, data managers, patient advocates, and<lb/> representatives of the NCI and Food and Drug<lb/> Administration. Between October, 2008 through February,<lb/> 2009, 727 surveys were collected. Most respondents<lb/> (93%) agreed that patient reporting of adverse symptoms<lb/> would be useful for improving understanding of the patient<lb/> experience with treatment in cancer trials, and 88%, 80%,<lb/> and 76%, respectively, endorsed that administration of<lb/> PRO-CTCAE items in clinical trials would improve the<lb/> completeness, accuracy, and efficiency of symptom data<lb/> collection. More than three fourths believed that patient<lb/> reports would be useful for informing treatment dose<lb/> modifications and towards FDA regulatory evaluation of<lb/> drugs. Eighty-eight percent felt that patients in clinical trials<lb/></div>
