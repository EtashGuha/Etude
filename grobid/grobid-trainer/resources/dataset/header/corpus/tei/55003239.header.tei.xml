	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> The effects of erythritol on the quality characteristics of Danish cookies<lb/> were studied. Danish cookies were formulated using erythritol as a sweetener<lb/> to replace 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% sucrose. The results showed that Hunter<lb/> L-values and erythritol contents of cookies increased with increasing erythri-<lb/>tol level whereas there was no difference in the moisture, protein, fat, ash and<lb/> hardness of cookies prepared with sucrose or erythritol. The erythritol was<lb/> stable during baking. In descriptive analysis, the surface color of cookies<lb/> became lighter, and the sweetness of cookies became less sweet as erythritol<lb/> level increased and sucrose decreased. The 50, 75 and 100% erythritol cookies<lb/> had a cooling sensation. The moistness and hardness of cookies showed no<lb/> difference among all samples. In hedonic test, the degree of surface color,<lb/> sweetness, hardness, flavor and overall liking of cookies prepared with 0, 25<lb/> and 50% replacement of sucrose with erythritol revealed no difference.<lb/> However, lower degree of sensory qualities (except hardness) liking of 75 and<lb/> 100% erythritol cookies was observed.<lb/></div>
