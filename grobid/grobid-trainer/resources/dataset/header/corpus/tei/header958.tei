		<div type="abstract">We reexamine the idea that the origin of black-hole entropy may lie in the entanglement of quantum <lb/> fields between the inside and outside of the horizon. Motivated by the observation that certain modes of <lb/> gravitational fluctuations in a black-hole background behave as scalar fields, we compute the entangle- <lb/> ment entropy of such a field, by tracing over its degrees of freedom inside a sphere. We show that while <lb/> this entropy is proportional to the area of the sphere when the field is in its ground state, a correction term <lb/> proportional to a fractional power of area results when the field is in a superposition of ground and excited <lb/> states. The area law is thus recovered for large areas. Further, we identify the location of the degrees of <lb/> freedom that give rise to the above entropy. <lb/></div>
