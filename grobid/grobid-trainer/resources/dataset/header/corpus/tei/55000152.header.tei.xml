	<div type="abstract">This paper reports a surface molecular self-assembly strat-<lb/>egy for molecular imprinting in electropolymerized polyami-<lb/>nothiophenol (PATP) membranes at the surface of gold<lb/> nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified glassy carbon (gc) electrode<lb/> for the electrochemical detection of pesticide chlorpyrifos<lb/> (CPF). Electropolmerizable p-aminothiophenol (ATP) was<lb/> first assembled on the AuNPs at the gc electrode surface<lb/> by the formation of Au-S bonds, and subsequently, the CPF<lb/> template was further assembled onto the monolayer of ATP<lb/> through the hydrogen-bonding interaction between amino<lb/> group and CPF. A conductive hybrid membrane was fabri-<lb/>cated at the assembled gc electrode by the electropolymer-<lb/>ization in a mixing solution containing additional ATP and<lb/> CPF templates, and meanwhile, the CPF was spontaneously<lb/> imprinted into the PATP/AuNP film. The amount of im-<lb/>printed sites at the PATP/AuNP film was significantly<lb/> increased due to the additional replenishment of CPF<lb/> templates. The cyclic voltammetric response of the im-<lb/>printed PATP-AuNP-gc sensor to CPF is about 3.2-fold as<lb/> compared with the imprinted PATP-Au sensor, and the<lb/> detection limit for CPF is about 2 orders of magnitude lower<lb/> than that by the imprinted PATP-Au sensor. An excellent<lb/> electrochemical selectivity for CPF over other pesticides was<lb/> also achieved. The combination of surface molecular self-<lb/>assembly with electropolymerized molecular imprinting on<lb/> a larger surface area of a AuNP-modified electrode produces<lb/> a high ratio of imprinted sites and, thus, provides an<lb/> ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of organophosphate<lb/> pesticide.<lb/></div>
<div type="introduction"> Organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) is widely used<lb/> in agriculture, household, and urban insecticide applications,<lb/> because of its high toxicity as an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase<lb/> that is necessary for normal function of nervous system.<lb/> 1 The<lb/> residue of CPF in agricultural products and the natural environ-<lb/>ment is extremely harmful to human health and zoology. Up to<lb/> now, various methods have already been proposed to assay CPF<lb/> and its metabolites by the use of complicated instruments such<lb/> as gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS)<lb/> detection 2-4 and liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry<lb/> (LC/MS).<lb/> 5-7 However, these instrumental analysis are usually<lb/> expensive, time-consuming, and tedious, and require sample<lb/> pretreatment and highly trained technical personnel. On the other<lb/> hand, enzyme/antibody-based immunoassay has also been de-<lb/>veloped for the detection of organophosphate CPF<lb/> 8-14 by the<lb/> readout of various electrochemical or optical transducers, such<lb/> as voltammetric response,<lb/> 15,16 surface plasmon resonance (SPR),</div>
