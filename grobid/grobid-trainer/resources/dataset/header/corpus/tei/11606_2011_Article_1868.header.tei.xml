	<div type="abstract">BACKGROUND: Following the 2006 Massachusetts<lb/> health care reform, an estimated 316,492 residents<lb/> remain uninsured. However, there have been no published<lb/> studies that examine why Massachusetts residents remain<lb/> uninsured four years into health reform.<lb/> OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of uninsured<lb/> patients seeking acute medical care in Massachusetts after<lb/> implementation of health care reform and reasons for<lb/> lacking insurance.<lb/> DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed an<lb/> in-person survey of a convenience sample of patients<lb/> visiting the emergency department of the state&apos;s second<lb/> largest safety net hospital between July 25, 2009 and<lb/> March 20, 2010. We interviewed 431 patients age 18–64,<lb/> 189 of whom were uninsured.<lb/> MAIN MEASURES: Demographic and clinical character-<lb/>istics, employment and insurance history, reasons for<lb/> lacking insurance and views of the state&apos;s new &quot; individual<lb/> mandate &quot; .<lb/> KEY RESULTS: The uninsured were largely employed<lb/> (65.9%), but only a quarter (25.1%) of the employed<lb/> uninsured had access to employer-sponsored insurance.<lb/> The majority qualified for subsidized insurance (85.7%<lb/> earned ≤300% of the federal poverty level), yet many<lb/> reported being unable to find affordable insurance<lb/> (32.7%). Over a third (35.2%) were uninsured because<lb/> they had lost insurance due predominantly to job loss or<lb/> policy cancellation. For nearly half of the uninsured<lb/> (48.6%), the individual mandate had motivated them to<lb/> try to find insurance, but they were unable to find<lb/> insurance they could afford.<lb/> CONCLUSIONS: After full implementation of the Massa-<lb/>chusetts health reform, those remaining without insur-<lb/>ance are largely the working poor who do not have access<lb/> to, or cannot afford, either employer sponsored insurance<lb/> or state subsidized insurance.<lb/> KEY WORDS: uninsured; health reform; health policy; safety-net<lb/> institutions; health insurance.<lb/></div>
