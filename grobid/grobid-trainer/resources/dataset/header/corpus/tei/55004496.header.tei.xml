	<div type="abstract">Effect of pH on Viscosity<lb/> Carbopol polymers must be neutralized in order to<lb/> achieve maximum viscosity. Unneutralized dispersions<lb/> have an approximate pH range of 2.5-3.5 depending<lb/> on the polymer concentration. The unneutralized<lb/> dispersions have very low viscosities, especially<lb/> Carbopol<lb/> ®<lb/> ETD and Ultrez polymers. Once a<lb/> neutralizer is added to the dispersion, thickening<lb/> gradually occurs as is demonstrated by Figure 1.<lb/> Optimum neutralization is achieved at a pH of<lb/> 6.5-7.0, but is not necessary. As demonstrated by<lb/> the graph, high viscosities can be achieved in a<lb/> range of 5.0-9.0.<lb/> A common question is &quot;what pH is correct for my<lb/> finished product?&quot; The answer is that there is no<lb/> correct or incorrect pH. pH should be determined<lb/> by the desired attributes for a given application.<lb/> Viscosity begins to decrease after a pH of 9.0, and<lb/> will continue to decrease if the pH is increased. This<lb/> is due to the dampening of the electrostatic repulsion<lb/> caused by the presence of excess electrolytes. It is<lb/> possible to achieve high viscosity systems at pH<lb/> values below 5 and above 9, but the use level of<lb/> the Carbopol polymer must be increased.<lb/>  </div>
