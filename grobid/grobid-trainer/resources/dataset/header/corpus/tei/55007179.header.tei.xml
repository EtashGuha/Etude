	</docTitle>

	<div type="abstract">Abstract. We introduce a new technique for automated performance diag-<lb/>nosis, using the program&apos;s callgraph. We discuss our implementation of this<lb/> diagnosis technique in the Paradyn Performance Consultant. Our implemen-<lb/>tation includes the new search strategy and new dynamic instrumentation to<lb/> resolve pointer-based dynamic call sites at run-time. We compare the effec-<lb/>tiveness of our new technique to the previous version of the Performance<lb/> Consultant for several sequential and parallel applications. Our results show<lb/> that the new search method performs its search while inserting dramatically<lb/> less instrumentation into the application, resulting in reduced application<lb/> perturbation and consequently a higher degree of diagnosis accuracy.<lb/></div>
