	<div type="abstract">C<lb/> oastal waters, lakes, and streams in the Pacific<lb/> Northwest provide a variety of seafoods including salmon<lb/> and many other fish, clams, oysters, shrimp, and crab.<lb/> You can enjoy these delicacies throughout the year if you<lb/> preserve them when supplies are abundant.<lb/> Canning is a popular method for preserving seafood.<lb/> Products are high in quality and safe to eat when you can<lb/> them correctly. It&apos;s important to pack and process<lb/> seafood as directed to guarantee safety. Processing<lb/> recommendations in this publication have been tested by<lb/> researchers.<lb/> Lemon juice, vinegar, salt, and oil are added to<lb/> maintain quality (flavor, color) of canned seafood. You<lb/> can leave them out of the recipes in this publication, if<lb/> you wish—but don&apos;t omit vinegar when you pickle these<lb/> products.<lb/> Use top-quality, fresh seafood. Can it as soon as<lb/> possible after you catch or buy it. The longer you wait,<lb/> the poorer the quality will be. To prevent spoilage, keep<lb/> fish and shellfish cold, on ice or in your refrigerator.<lb/> Handle raw seafood safely. Raw seafood may contain<lb/> microorganisms that cause food poisoning. These<lb/> bacteria are destroyed by heating the seafood before<lb/> eating. Make sure that you wash your hands, utensils, and<lb/> work surfaces (such as cutting boards) after handling raw<lb/> seafood. Don&apos;t let raw seafood come into contact with<lb/> cooked seafood.<lb/> First steps<lb/> @BULLET Keep live shellfish (clams, oysters, mussels) moist and<lb/> cold. Place them in a bowl, cover with a wet cloth, and<lb/> store in the refrigerator.<lb/> @BULLET Keep fish on ice. Avoid rough handling. Don&apos;t stack<lb/> fish on top of one another—this causes crushing and<lb/> bruising, which speeds up spoilage.<lb/> @BULLET Keep live crab cool.<lb/></div>
