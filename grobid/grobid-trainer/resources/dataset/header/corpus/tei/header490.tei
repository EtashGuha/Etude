		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>A simple and efficient algorithm for finding the closest points between two convex polyhedra is described <lb/>here. Data from numerous experiments tested on a <lb/>broad set of convex polyhedra on &amp;lt; 3 show that the <lb/>running time is roughly constant for finding closest <lb/>points when nearest points are approximately known <lb/>and is linear in total number of vertices if no special <lb/>initialization is done. This algorithm can be used for <lb/>collision detection, computation of the distance between two polyhedra in three-dimensional space, and <lb/>other robotics problems. It forms the heart of the <lb/>motion planning algorithm of [1]. <lb/></div>
