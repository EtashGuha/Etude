		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We consider the problem of planning sensor control strategies that enable a <lb/>sensor to be automatically configured for robot tasks. In this paper we present <lb/>robust and efficient algorithms for computing the regions from which a sensor <lb/>has unobstructed or partially obstructed views of a target in a goal. We apply <lb/>these algorithms to the Error Detection and Recovery problem of recognizing <lb/>whether a goal or failure region has been achieved. Based on these methods and <lb/>strategies for visually-cued camera control, we have built a robot surveillance <lb/>system in which one mobile robot navigates to a viewing position from which <lb/>it has an unobstructed view of a goal region, and then uses visual recognition <lb/>to detect when a specific target has entered the region. <lb/></div>
