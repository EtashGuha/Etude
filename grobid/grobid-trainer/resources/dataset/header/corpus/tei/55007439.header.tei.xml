	<titlePart>EFFECT OF THE SELECTED STRAINS FROM LACTOBACILLUS GENUS ON THE<lb/> LIMITATION OF MOULD AND OCHRATOXIN A CONTAMINATION OF SILAGES<lb/> FROM MEADOW SWARD<lb/></titlePart>
	</docTitle>

	<div type="abstract">Summary<lb/> The aim of the studies, conducted in ecological and traditional farms, was to determine the effect of application of bacterial<lb/> preparation, consisting of the selected bacterial strains from Lactobacillus genus on the improvement of nutritional value<lb/> and quality of silages produced from meadow sward, on inhibition of mould development and on lowering of ochratoxin A<lb/> content during ensiling process. Starter culture of the preparation included the selected lactic acid bacteria strains from the<lb/> species: Lactobacillus plantarum K KKP 593/p, Lactobacillus plantarum C KKP 788/p and Lactobacillus buchneri KKP<lb/> 907. The experimental silages from the meadow sward, as prepared in manufacturing conditions with the addition of the<lb/> examined preparation, were characterized by a very good quality, evaluated according to Flieg-Zimmer, with lactic acid<lb/> level higher by more than 50% and absence of butyric acid as well as by a high microbiological purity, expressed by<lb/> thousand times lower CFU of moulds/ 1g of silage. As affected by synergic action of the selected strains of lactic acid<lb/> bacteria, lowering of ochratoxin A level by ca. 62 – 72% was found, in relation to its content in the meadow sward.</div>
