				This paper is focused on the monitoring of the primary drying phase of the lyophilisation process of pharmaceuticals<lb/>
				in vial. Monitoring is required to ensure that the maximum temperature of the product is maintained at a safe<lb/>
				value in order to avoid denaturation, and the position of the moving front of sublimation has to be monitored<lb/>
				since its evolution gives the state of progression of the primary drying. Furthermore, the information coming from<lb/>
				the monitoring system, which includes the estimation of the transport coefficients, can be used in a control loop<lb/>
				designed to minimise the drying time beside ensuring product quality.<lb/>
				To this purpose, a soft-sensor (observer) has been developed, based on the extended Kalman filter algorithm: it<lb/>
				requires a model of the process (a simplified model is used in order to reduce the computational load) and some<lb/>
				physical measurements (in this case the temperature of the product at the bottom of the vial, that can be measured<lb/>
				by a thermocouple). The main issues arising in the design of this observer have been discussed. A detailed mono-<lb/>
				dimensional model experimentally validated has been used at first to compare the results provided by the observer<lb/>
				by means of numerical simulations, and then the results obtained in a pilot freeze-dryer are shown.<lb/>
