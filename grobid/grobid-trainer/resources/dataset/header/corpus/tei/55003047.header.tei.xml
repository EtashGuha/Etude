	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Wireless LAN security has been a hot-topic of discussion since the discovery that the WEP encryption standard is not<lb/> adequate enough to protect a wireless LAN access from being compromised. This paper introduces a novel proximity-<lb/>based packet filtering architecture that extends the Linux netfilter system to support packet filtering based on the<lb/> proximity of a user&apos;s wireless LAN device to a monitoring point. A method of transparent 802.11 wireless LAN location<lb/> acquisition is detailed as well as the methods used to obtain the raw signal data and the pathloss model utilized for<lb/> distance calculations. This context information is translated to the logic for dynamically generating the access control list<lb/> of the packet filtering firewall. The performance of the pathloss model and benchmark results of the implemented<lb/> prototype system is provided.<lb/></div>
