	<div type="abstract">Body<lb/> Regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets receptors expressed by tumour and/or endothelial cells. In this study, plasma<lb/> protein biomarkers were quantified using multiplex bead immunoassays. Plasma was obtained at baseline and after 15 days of daily<lb/> regorafenib treatment from 29 pts with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic RCC enrolled in a Phase II trial that<lb/> demonstrated regorafenib clinical activity. Biomarkers examined included soluble forms of receptors inhibited by regorafenib (eg<lb/> sVEGFR2, sKIT) and their ligands (eg VEGF, SCF), in addition to other molecules associated with angiogenesis (eg HGF), hypoxia<lb/> (eg CA IX), apoptosis (eg CK18M30, CYTC) and tumour invasion (eg TIMP2). Statistical analyses were performed to determine if<lb/> biomarker levels changed in response to regorafenib exposure. In addition, correlations between biomarkers and clinical response,<lb/> indicated by maximum change in tumour size, were examined. Results indicate that a subset of biomarkers was altered by<lb/> regorafenib (increase: PLGF, CA IX, FASL, CYTC, CK18M30, VEGFA, VEGFD, ANG2; decrease: sVEGFR2, sKIT, sTIE1,<lb/> bFGF, TIMP2, TIMP4, SCF). The most consistent, robust changes were in PLGF (increase in 28/29 pts; median fold change of<lb/> +3.3; p&lt;0.0001) and sVEGFR2 (decrease in 29/29 pts; median fold change of âˆ’1.6; p&lt;0.0001). Notably, circulating levels of<lb/> several receptors that may be targeted by regorafenib (sVEGFR2, sKIT, sTIE1) were decreased. Several members of the VEGF<lb/> family of ligands (PLGF, VEGFA, VEGFD) were increased. Biomarkers that did not change include ANG1, GCSF, HGF, IL16,<lb/> MCSF, sMCSFR, OPN, PDGFAA, AB and BB, SDF1a, sTIE2, TIMP1 and 3, VEGFC, and sVEGFR1 and 3. Three biomarkers<lb/> whose levels were modulated by regorafenib (sKIT, CYTC, CK18M30) exhibited a correlation between degree of change and<lb/> clinical response. Baseline levels of a subset of biomarkers (IL16, SCF, HGF, TIMP2) were also associated with clinical response.<lb/> Results suggest potential mechanisms for the anticancer activity of regorafenib (eg antiangiogenesis) and identify biomarkers that<lb/> are potentially predictive of clinical response in pts with RCC and warrant further investigation.<lb/> ESMO Abstract Submission<lb/></div>
