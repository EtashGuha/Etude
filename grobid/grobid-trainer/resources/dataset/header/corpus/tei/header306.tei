		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The retrieval of images based on their visual similarity <lb/>to an example image is an important and fascinating area of <lb/>research. Here, a method to characterize visual appearance <lb/>for determining global similarity in images is described. <lb/>Images are filtered with Gaussian derivatives and geometric features are computed from the filtered images. <lb/>The geometric features used here are curvature and phase. <lb/>Two images may be said to be similar if they have similar distributions of such features. Global similarity may, <lb/>therefore, be deduced by comparing histograms of these <lb/>features. This allows for rapid retrieval and examples from <lb/>collection of gray-level and trademark images are shown. <lb/></div>
