		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>To maximize the benefit and minimize the overhead of software-based latency tolerance techniques, <lb/>we would like to apply them precisely to the set of <lb/>dynamic references that suffer cache misses. Unfortunately, the information provided by the state-of-the-art cache miss profiling technique (summary profiling) <lb/>is inadequate for references with intermediate miss <lb/>ratios|it results in either failing to hide latency, or <lb/>else inserting unnecessary overhead. To overcome this <lb/>problem, we propose and evaluate a new technique| <lb/>correlation profiling|which improves predictability by <lb/>correlating the caching behavior with the associated dynamic context. Our experimental results demonstrate <lb/>that roughly half of the 22 non-numeric applications <lb/>we study can potentially enjoy significant reductions <lb/>in memory stall time by exploiting at least one of the <lb/>three forms of correlation profiling we consider. <lb/></div>
