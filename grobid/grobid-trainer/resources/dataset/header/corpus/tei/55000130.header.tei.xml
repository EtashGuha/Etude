<div type = "introduction"> T<lb/> he Wembley sour gas plant operated by ConocoPhillips<lb/> is located near Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada. It<lb/> processes a wide range of raw gases containing neg-<lb/>ligible quantities of H 2 S and CO 2 with concentrations as high<lb/> as 10% acid gas. The method employed to remove these<lb/> undesirable components is via contacting the inlet gas with an<lb/> aqueous alkanolamine solvent. In this process, the raw inlet<lb/> gas mixes with the solution, causing the acid gas components<lb/> to react with the amine, which forms a regenerable salt in<lb/> the aqueous phase. This process is the most widely utilised<lb/> throughout the industry for sweetening sour natural gas 1 .<lb/> The amine solution is regenerated by adding heat at<lb/> low pressure in the amine regenerator. Rich amine solution<lb/> enters the top of a trayed regenerator column and at the<lb/> bottom of this tower there is a reboiler that supplies heat to<lb/> the system. As the solution flows down the vessel it heats<lb/> up, causing the acid gases to disassociate from the amine<lb/> and the water to vaporise. The solution that reaches the<lb/> bottom of the amine regenerator has essentially had all<lb/> of the acid gases removed. The lean bottom solution is<lb/> cooled and recycled to treat additional incoming raw gas.<lb/> The acid gas flow from the top of the amine regenera-<lb/>tor consists primarily of a water saturated stream of CO 2<lb/> and H 2 S. As this stream is cooled in the overhead air<lb/> exchanger some of the water condenses and is recovered<lb/> by refluxing to the column via the reflux drum. At this point<lb/> in an alkanolamines process, there are several options for<lb/> dealing with the residual H 2 S/CO 2 components that have<lb/> been removed from the raw sour gas. The method utilised<lb/> at the Wembley gas plant is to reinject this acid gas back<lb/> into a well that has been completed to allow for safe dis-<lb/>posal. This method ensures that there is no H 2 S, SO 2 or<lb/> CO 2 released into the atmosphere and does not require<lb/> stockpiling of sulfur onsite.<lb/> Acid gas injection process overview<lb/> The Wembley gas plant typically produces 60 -100 e<lb/> 3<lb/> m<lb/> 3<lb/> /d<lb/> (1000s of m<lb/> 3<lb/> /d) of acid gas from two separate amine regen-<lb/>eration towers. Composition of the gas has a large amount<lb/> of day to day variation depending on the particular wells<lb/> being processed through the plant and also on the degree<lb/> of CO 2 slippage occurring in the amine contactors. The ratio<lb/> of H 2 S to CO 2 ranges between 40:60 -85:15. In addition<lb/> to the acid gas components, the stream is water saturated<lb/> at the amine regeneration overhead process conditions,<lb/> typically 4C and approximately 35 kPag. It also contains<lb/> some hydrocarbons, mainly methane, due to small amounts<lb/> of these components being dissolved in the aqueous amine<lb/> solution as it flows through the contactor. These hydrocar-<lb/>bons are liberated in the amine regenerator and generally<lb/> amount to less than 1% of the overhead flow.<lb/> Since the acid gas coming from the regenerator is only<lb/> slightly above atmospheric, six stages of compression are<lb/> required in order to boost the pressure to the appropriate<lb/> range between 10 000 -20 000 kPag so it can be disposed<lb/> of into the injection well. The acid gas compressor consists<lb/> of a single frame containing six throws. Two of the throws<lb/> are utilised for the first stage to account for the large vol-<lb/>umes at low suction pressures, while the fifth and sixth<lb/> stages are located on the head end/crank end of a single<lb/> throw. There is a suction scrubber located before the first<lb/> stage to knock out any liquid water formed due to cool-<lb/>ing in the piping between the regeneration units and the<lb/> compressor. Each interstage contains a cooling section fol-<lb/>lowed by a suction scrubber prior to the subsequent stage<lb/> of compression. Suction scrubbers for the first four stages<lb/> of compression dump back to a low pressure sour water<lb/> tank, while the fifth and sixth stage scrubber dumps flow to</div>
