	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Objectives Wet milling is a common technique to produce drug nanocrystals. Stability<lb/> of the nanocrystals is a critical question, and different kinds of stabilizers, e.g. polymers,<lb/> celluloses, surfactants and lipids, have been tested for various drugs. Still, the question about<lb/> how to select the best stabilizer to a certain drug material and also to a selected process<lb/> is open.<lb/> Key findings Many different factors, such as surface energy, hydrophobicity, solubility,<lb/> viscosity and functional groups, affect the stability of the formed nanosuspensions. Affinity<lb/> of the stabilizer to the particle surfaces seems to be the most important parameter. This<lb/> affinity is partly related to the surface energy and hydrophobicity of the surfaces and<lb/> stabilizers.<lb/> Summary In this review the most important factors affecting nanocrystal formulation and<lb/> efficacy of stabilizers are presented. In order to widen understanding of the milling process,<lb/> the most important variables related to milling techniques and particle fracturing processes<lb/> during the milling are briefly presented.<lb/></div>
