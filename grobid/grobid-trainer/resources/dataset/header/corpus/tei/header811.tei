		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Crosstalk has become a major issue in VLSI design due to the high frequency, long <lb/>interconnecting lines and small spacing between interconnects in today&apos;s integrated circuits. <lb/>In this paper, we study the problem of crosstalk minimization in 3-layer HVH channel <lb/>routing. A heuristic algorithm that combines layer reassignment and track reassignment <lb/>is presented. This algorithm can iteratively modify the layout so that the crosstalk in the <lb/>channel is minimized. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can reduce the <lb/>crosstalk by an average of 16.4% on a set of benchmark examples. <lb/></div>
