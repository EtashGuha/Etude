	<div type="abstract">Summary<lb/> Analysis of female meiosis (megasporogenesis) and embryo sac development (megagametogenesis) in<lb/> angiosperms is technically challenging because the cells are enclosed within the nucellus and ovule tissues of<lb/> the female flower. This is in contrast to male sporogenesis and gametogenesis where development can readily<lb/> be observed through the easily dissectable developing anthers. Observation of embryo sac development is a<lb/> particular problem in crassinucellate ovules such as those of maize. To overcome the problems in observing<lb/> reproductive development, we developed a simple Feulgen staining procedure optimized for use with confocal<lb/> microscopy to observe reproductive progression in the crassinucellate ovules of maize. The procedure greatly<lb/> facilitates the observation of nuclei and cell structures of all stages of megasporogenesis and embryo sac<lb/> development. The high resolution obtained using the technique enabled us to readily visualize chromosomes<lb/> from individual cells within ovule tissue samples of maize. A propidium iodide staining technique was also<lb/> used and compared with the Feulgen-based technique. Static cytometry of relative DNA content of individual<lb/> nuclei was possible using Imaris software on both Feulgen and propidium iodide-stained samples. The<lb/> techniques also proved successful for the observation of Arabidopsis and Hieracium aurantiacum female<lb/> gametophyte and seed development, demonstrating the general applicability of the techniques. Using both<lb/> staining methods, we analysed the maize meiotic mutant elongate1, which produces functional diploid<lb/> instead of haploid embryo sacs. The precise defect in meiosis from which diploid embryo sacs arise in<lb/> elongate1 has not previously been reported. We used confocal microscopy followed by static cytometry using<lb/> Imaris software to show that the defect by which diploid embryo sacs arise in the maize mutant elongate1 is<lb/> the absence of meiosis II with one of the dyad cells directly initiating megagametogenesis.<lb/></div>
