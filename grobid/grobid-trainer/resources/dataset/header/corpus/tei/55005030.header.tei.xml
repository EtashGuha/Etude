			<div type="abstract"> a b s t r a c t<lb/> This paper presents the research results of a
				comparison of three different model based<lb/> approaches for wind turbine fault
				detection in online SCADA data, by applying<lb/> developed models to five real
				measured faults and anomalies. The regression based<lb/> model as the simplest
				approach to build a normal behavior model is compared to two<lb/> artificial neural
				network based approaches, which are a full signal reconstruction and an<lb/>
				autoregressive normal behavior model. Based on a real time series containing
				two<lb/> generator bearing damages the capabilities of identifying the incipient
				fault prior to the<lb/> actual failure are investigated. The period after the first
				bearing damage is used to<lb/> develop the three normal behavior models. The
				developed or trained models are used to<lb/> investigate how the second damage
				manifests in the prediction error. Furthermore the<lb/> full signal reconstruction
				and the autoregressive approach are applied to further real<lb/> time series
				containing gearbox bearing damages and stator temperature anomalies.<lb/> The
				comparison revealed all three models being capable of detecting incipient
				faults.<lb/> However, they differ in the effort required for model development and
				the remaining<lb/> operational time after first indication of damage. The general
				nonlinear neural network<lb/> approaches outperform the regression model. The
				remaining seasonality in the regres-<lb/> sion model prediction error makes it
				difficult to detect abnormality and leads to<lb/> increased alarm levels and thus a
				shorter remaining operational period. For the bearing<lb/> damages and the stator
				anomalies under investigation the full signal reconstruction<lb/> neural network
				gave the best fault visibility and thus led to the highest confidence level.<lb/>
