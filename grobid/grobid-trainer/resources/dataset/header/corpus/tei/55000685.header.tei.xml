	<div type="abstract">Abstract: Since the terrestrial digital sound and data<lb/> broadcasting system Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) utilizes<lb/> a channel bandwidth up to 10 kHz only, a DRM software can<lb/> be implemented on a conventional personal computer (PC)<lb/> with a sound card. This paper presents a real-time MATLAB<lb/> based open source software radio called Diorama. In addi-<lb/>tion to offering many features for educational and research<lb/> purposes, Diorama includes synchronization for sampling<lb/> rate adjustment, frequency offset and channel estimation<lb/> based on all pilots and 2D-Wiener filtering as well as soft-<lb/>input multi-stage decoding.<lb/></div>
