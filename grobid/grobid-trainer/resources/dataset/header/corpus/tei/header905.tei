		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper presents two strategies for reducing the impact force resulting from the collision of a <lb/>kinematically redundant manipulator with its environment, where it is assumed that the impact <lb/>event has some finite duration. The first, an impact control strategy, involves adding torques to the <lb/>joints of the redundant manipulator to impede motion into the environment with which it is colliding. The second, an impact planning strategy, involves choosing the configuration best suited for <lb/>minimizing the impact force from an impact event, the approximate location of which is known <lb/>ahead of time. Simulated results from both strategies are presented and discussed, and it is shown <lb/>that both are successful in minimizing the impact force resulting from planned and unplanned collisions. <lb/></div>
