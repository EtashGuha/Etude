		<div type="abstract">Abstract. In order to make spoken dialogue systems more sophisticated, designers need to better understand the conventions that people <lb/>use in structuring their speech and in interacting with their fellow con-versants. In particular, it is crucial to discriminate the basic building <lb/>blocks of dialogue and how they affect the way people process language. Many researchers have proposed the utterance unit as the <lb/>primary object of study, but defining exactly what this is has remained a difficult issue. To shed light on this question, we consider <lb/>grounding behavior in dialogue, and examine co-occurrences between <lb/>turn-initial grounding acts and utterance unit signals that have been <lb/>proposed in the literal, namely prosodic boundary tones and pauses. <lb/>Preliminary results indicate high correlation between grounding and <lb/>boundary tones, with a secondary correlation for longer pauses. We <lb/>also consider some of the dialogue processing issues which are impacted by a definition of utterance unit. <lb/></div>
