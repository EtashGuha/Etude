		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In the approximate pattern matching problem, the text area to be searched <lb/>for an occurrence of a pattern can be pruned by applying a filtration condition. A q-gram based filtration condition defines potential text areas in terms <lb/>of pattern q-grams, i.e., strings of length q. A text area will be checked by <lb/>an accurate method only if the set of the q-grams in the text area satisfies a <lb/>certain condition. One hopes that the filtration limits the number of checks <lb/>to a minimum, thus making the algorithm quite efficient. However, computer experiments show that the filtration method works fine for cases when <lb/>the allowed error level k is relatively small compared to the pattern length, <lb/>but loses its efficiency quite sharply with an increasing k. This is a phase <lb/>transition phenomenon that is quite often observed in nature. In this paper, <lb/>we present a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon which will excuse <lb/>us to introduce advanced mathematical analysis based on certain languages, <lb/>correlation polynomials, generating functions and complex analysis. It is our <lb/>view that nothing can be more exciting and rewarding than finding a theoretical justification for an abrupt manifestation of nature. <lb/></div>
