		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper presents an efficient algorithm for constructing Bayesian belief networks from databases. The <lb/>algorithm takes a database and an attributes ordering (i.e., the causal attributes of an attribute should appear earlier <lb/>in the order) as input and constructs a belief network structure as output. The construction process is based on the <lb/>computation of mutual information of attribute pairs. Given a data set which is large enough and has a DAG-Isomorphic probability distribution, this algorithm guarantees that the perfect map [1] of the underlying dependency <lb/>model is generated, and at the same time, enjoys the time complexity of O N( ) 2 on conditional independence (CI) <lb/>tests. To evaluate this algorithm, we present the experimental results on three versions of the well-known ALARM <lb/>network database, which has 37 attributes and 10,000 records. The correctness proof and the analysis of <lb/>computational complexity are also presented. We also discuss the features of our work and relate it to previous <lb/>works. <lb/></div>
