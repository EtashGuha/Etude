		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We argue that the specification of an object&apos;s functional behavior and the timing constraints imposed <lb/>on it may be separated. Specifically, we describe <lb/>RTsynchronizer, a high-level programming language <lb/>construct for specifying real-time constraints between <lb/>objects in a distributed concurrent system. During program execution, RTsynchronizers affect the <lb/>scheduling of distributed objects to enforce real-time <lb/>relations between events. Objects in our system are <lb/>defined in terms of the actor model extended with <lb/>timing assumptions. Separation of the functional <lb/>behaviors of actors and the timing constraints on <lb/>patterns of actor invocation provides at least three <lb/>important advantages. First, it simplifies code development by separating design concerns. Second, <lb/>multiple timing constraints can be independently <lb/>specified and composed. And finally, a specification <lb/>of timing constraints can be reused even if the <lb/>representation of the functional behavior of actors has <lb/>changed, and conversely. <lb/>A number of examples are given to illustrate the <lb/>use of RTsynchronizers. These examples illustrate <lb/>how real-time constraints for periodic events, simultaneous events, exception handling, and producer-consumer may be specified. <lb/></div>
