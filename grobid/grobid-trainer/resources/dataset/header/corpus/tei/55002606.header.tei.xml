	<div type="abstract">Abstract. Edition of books has changed. Ten years ago, there were<lb/> only two on-line publishers, both of them non-profit organisations. Nowa-<lb/>days, a number of companies provide one-size-fits-all on-line shops for<lb/> on-line publishers or on-line self-published authors. On-line publications,<lb/> however, tend to fall in one of the following categories<lb/> @BULLET project Gutenberg<lb/> @BULLET webpages<lb/> @BULLET proprietary formats<lb/> @BULLET open formats restricted by patents to proprietary readers.<lb/> The OpenBerg project aims at providing free, open-source and open-<lb/>standard tools for digital publication (a.k.a. e-Publishing), for use by<lb/> authors, readers and editors. In particular, our main effort is the develop-<lb/>ment of OpenBerg Reader, a cross-platform, multi-format, e-Book reader<lb/> targetted towards textbooks, exercise books and academic content.<lb/> This document describes the key notions of OpenBerg Reader, the<lb/> choices we made regarding our tools and platforms, as well as the current<lb/> status of the implementation and our plans for the future. The objective<lb/> of this document is to serve as a reference for the developers of OpenBerg<lb/> Reader and the associated tools. As OpenBerg Reader and the open-<lb/>source world in general, this document is intended as a permanent work-<lb/>in-progress, to be completed as we add features and specifications.</div>
