	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> This paper presents the results of a round robin exercise<lb/> recently undertaken under the auspices of the<lb/> Transportation Stresses working group of the Committee<lb/> of European Environmental Engineering Societies (CEEES).<lb/> A total of 22 agencies from 6 different European countries<lb/> participated in this work. Each participant undertook<lb/> analysis of an identical piece of measured data. The<lb/> majority of the participants reported analysis of the data,<lb/> many also derived test severities. This paper presents a<lb/> basic comparison of the responses and assesses the<lb/> results.<lb/></div>
