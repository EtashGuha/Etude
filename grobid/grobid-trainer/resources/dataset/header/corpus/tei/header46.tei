		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Using the Trellis human/computer interaction model as an implementation vehicle, we demonstrate <lb/>how to use concurrency-supporting hypertext to provide visual displays of the execution flows through <lb/>a parallel Lisp program. In addition to displays, the hypertext interface allows injection of control <lb/>flow into an otherwise functional computation, and therefore provides reader control over the order of <lb/>evaluation of expressions. The resulting system, termed Trellis, can be thought of as a concurrent control <lb/>flow browser for composing functional computations, providing a visual implementation of kernel-control <lb/>decomposition. The advantages of Trellis are ease of exploring program side effects; ease of debugging <lb/>parallel code; aid in teaching functional languages; and the ability to construct hypertext documents <lb/>that have parallel execution semantics and flexible browsing behaviors. <lb/>Key words: functional programming, parallelism, kernel-control decomposition, Lisp, hypertext, exe <lb/>cution visualization. <lb/></div>
