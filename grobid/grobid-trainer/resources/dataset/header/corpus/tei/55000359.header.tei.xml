	<div type="abstract">Abstract:<lb/> This deliverable presents the characteristics and implementation of the multi-user multi-cell cooperation<lb/> prototype developed in activity 6A3. The aim of this prototype is to demonstrate within the scope of<lb/> ROCKET, the implementation feasibility of a cooperation algorithm that allows mobiles near the cell or<lb/> sector edge to share time-frequency resources with minimal interference. For this activity, propagation<lb/> scenarios and channel models are used from the ROCKET system characterization in WP1 while the<lb/> cooperation algorithm has been studied in detail in WP3.<lb/> In this deliverable, after a brief overview of the usage scenario, the overall prototype composition and the<lb/> algorithm selected for implementation, a detailed description of the demonstrator is provided. Then, the<lb/> implementation of the algorithm in each component and nodes of the test-bed including their interactions<lb/> and the development of novel hardware processing, implementation and integration techniques is<lb/> described. The evaluation and validation of the employed algorithm is obtained through specific system<lb/> configurations carried out on the hardware platform and consolidated by measurements that demonstrate<lb/> the efficacy of the proposed ROCKET technique.<lb/></div>
