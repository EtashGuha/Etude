	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> This paper introduces a new type of interface for 3D<lb/> drawings that improves the usability of gestural interfaces<lb/> and augments typical command-based modeling systems. In<lb/> our suggestive interface, the user gives hints about a desired<lb/> operation to the system by highlighting related geometric<lb/> components in the scene. The system then infers possible<lb/> operations based on the hints and presents the results of<lb/> these operations as small thumbnails. The user completes<lb/> the editing operation simply by clicking on the desired<lb/> thumbnail. The hinting mechanism lets the user specify<lb/> geometric relations among graphical components in the<lb/> scene, and the multiple thumbnail suggestions make it<lb/> possible to define many operations with relatively few<lb/> distinct hint patterns. The suggestive interface system is<lb/> implemented as a set of suggestion engines working in<lb/> parallel, and is easily extended by adding customized<lb/> engines. Our prototype 3D drawing system, Chateau, shows<lb/> that a suggestive interface can effectively support<lb/> construction of various 3D drawings.<lb/></div>
