	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> We survey a new paradigm in signal processing known as &quot;compressive sensing&quot;.<lb/> Contrary to old practices of data acquisition and reconstruction based on the Shannon-<lb/>Nyquist sampling principle, the new theory shows that it is possible to reconstruct<lb/> images or signals of scientific interest accurately and even exactly from a number of<lb/> samples which is far smaller than the desired resolution of the image/signal, e.g., the<lb/> number of pixels in the image. This new technique draws from results in several fields<lb/> of mathematics, including algebra, optimization, probability theory, and harmonic<lb/> analysis. We will discuss some of the key mathematical ideas behind compressive<lb/> sensing, as well as its implications to other fields: numerical analysis, information<lb/> theory, theoretical computer science, and engineering.<lb/></div>
