		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Recovery from failures and erroneous executions is a crucial but complicated issue for concurrently accessed data systems. Increasingly sophisticated techniques are being developed to improve performance <lb/>and functionality of recovery protocols. To better understand and analyze recovery schemes, we reexamine the concept of spheres of control [Dav78], using it as a unifying framework for specifying diverse <lb/>recovery models simply and precisely. We constrain sphere-of-control formulations appropriately to capture transaction-oriented recovery in both centralized and distributed environments and with different <lb/>types of schedules, as well as semantics-based recovery and compensation. In addition, we discuss how <lb/>the operational semantics methodology of evolving algebras [Gur95] can model spheres of control formally <lb/>and refine them to lower levels of abstraction. <lb/></div>
