		<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT <lb/>This paper applies genetic programming <lb/>to the evolution of intelligent agents that <lb/>gradually build internal representations of <lb/>their surroundings for later use in <lb/>planning. The method used allows for the <lb/>creation of dynamically determined <lb/>representations that are not pre-designed <lb/>by the human creator of the system. In an <lb/>illustrative path-planning problem, evolved <lb/>programs learn a model of their world and <lb/>use this internal representation to plan <lb/>their successive actions. The results show <lb/>that the proposed method is successful in <lb/>evolving programs that solve the planning <lb/>problem and is thus a worthy basis for <lb/>further investigation. <lb/></div>
