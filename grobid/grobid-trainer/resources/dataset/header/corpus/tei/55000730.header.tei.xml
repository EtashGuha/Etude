	<div type="abstract">F r o m T h e E d i t o r<lb/> The Internet Protocol Journal continues to be a forum for discussion of<lb/> current and emerging technologies. In this issue, we first look at con-<lb/>tent networking. One can describe the Internet as a system of<lb/> interconnected devices, but equally as a collection of information, called<lb/> content, that resides on a distributed set of servers and is accessed by<lb/> numerous clients. Our first article is by Christophe Deleuze.<lb/> Engineers are hard at work planning for an eventual transition to the<lb/> next version of IP — IPv6. We&apos;ve published several articles about IPv6<lb/> in previous editions. This time, François Donzé describes the automatic<lb/> address configuration feature of IPv6. Of note is also the increasing glo-<lb/>bal support for IPv6 deployment, (refer to &quot;Fragments&quot; on page 31).<lb/> Our final article returns to our recurring theme: adding security to exist-<lb/>ing Internet protocols. Because many malicious attacks on the Internet<lb/> are perpetrated by &quot;spoofing&quot; information in one form or another, it<lb/> makes sense to look at the Domain Name System (DNS), a critical com-<lb/>ponent of the Internet infrastructure. Today, it is possible to create<lb/> systems which provide fake answers to DNS queries. Miek Gieben ex-<lb/>plains what is being done to address this issue in his tutorial on<lb/> DNSSEC, the secure version of the DNS protocols.<lb/> Please take a moment to renew or update your subscription to this jour-<lb/>nal.
