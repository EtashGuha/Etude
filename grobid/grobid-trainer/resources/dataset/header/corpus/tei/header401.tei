		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>With submicron technologies, gate delays are dominated by gate <lb/>load delays rather than intrinsic gate delays. While the common approach for computing gate load delay (or total gate delay) is through <lb/>delay tables (or k-factor equations), there are important methodology problems associated with the delay table approach. In this paper, we propose a gate driver model with a Thevenin equivalent circuit consisting of a ramp voltage source whose slew time is obtained <lb/>from the gate slew tables, and a driver resistance in series with the <lb/>gate load. We then develop analytical gate delay formulas using this <lb/>Thevenin driver model and modeling the load with various gate load <lb/>models under both rising and falling ramp input. <lb/></div>
