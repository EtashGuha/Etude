	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/>The efficiency and high specificity of tobacco etchvirus (TEV) protease has made it widely used for cleavage of recombinant<lb/> fusion proteins. However, the production of TEV protease in E.coliis hampered by low solubility. We have subjected the gene<lb/> encoding TEV protease to directed evolution to improve the yield of soluble protein. Libraries of mutated genes obtained by<lb/> error-prone PCR and gene shuffling were introduced into the Gateway cloning system for facilitated transfer between vectors<lb/> for screening, purification, or other applications. Fluorescence based in vivo solubility screening was carried out by cloning the<lb/> libraries into a plasmid encoding aC-terminal GFP fusion. Mutant genes giving rise to high GFP fluorescence intensity indicating<lb/> high levels of soluble TEV–GFP were subsequently transferred to a vector providing a C-terminal histidine tag for expression,<lb/> purification, and activity tests of  mutated TEV. We identified a mutant, TEVSH, in which three amino acid substitutions result in<lb/> a five-fold increase in the yield of purified protease with retained activity.<lb/></div>
