It may differ significantly from the current revision (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init) .<lb/> (diff) ← Previous revision | Latest revision (diff) | Newer revision → (diff)<lb/> init (short for initialization) is the program on Unix and Unix-like systems that spawns all other processes. It runs as a daemon and typically has PID 1.<lb/> The functionality diverged, in Unixes such as System III and System V, from the functionality provided by the init in Research Unix and its BSD derivatives. The usage on most Linux distributions is<lb/> compatible with System V, but some distributions, such as Arch and Slackware, use a BSD-style and others, such as Gentoo, have their own customized version. Ubuntu<lb/> [1][2] and some other Linux<lb/> distros now use upstart<lb/> [3] as a replacement<lb/> [4] for the traditional Init process.<lb/></div>
