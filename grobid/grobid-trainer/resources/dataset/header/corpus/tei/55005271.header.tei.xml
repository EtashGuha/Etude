	<div type="abstract">M<lb/> any popular bacterial ex-<lb/>pression systems, including<lb/> the pET system, contain<lb/> components of the lac<lb/> operon. For example, in the pET system<lb/> transcription of the target gene is controlled<lb/> by a bacteriophage T7 promoter, and the<lb/> production of the T7 RNA polymerase in<lb/> expression hosts (Î»DE3 lysogens) is regu-<lb/>lated by a lac promoter derivative, the E.<lb/> coli L8-UV5 lac promoter (see Figure 1).<lb/> Negative regulation by<lb/> repressor<lb/> The wild type lac operon has two dis-<lb/>tinct mechanisms of regulation; one is nega-<lb/>tive (decreases transcription), and the other<lb/> is positive (stimulates transcription).<lb/> Negative regulation is mediated by the lac<lb/> repressor. Transcription initiation begins<lb/> with the binding of E. coli RNA polymerase<lb/> to the promoter; however, the successful<lb/> transition from transcription initiation to<lb/> transcription elongation can be influenced<lb/> by downstream elements. Between the pro-<lb/>moter and the coding regions in the operon<lb/> is the lac operator, which is a specific DNA<lb/> sequence to which lac repressor binds. The<lb/> binding of repressor to the operator greatly<lb/> decreases the frequency of successful tran-<lb/>scription elongation events by the RNA<lb/> polymerase. Inducers of the lac operon (e.g.,<lb/> IPTG) permit transcription because they<lb/> bind to the lac repressor and substantially<lb/> decrease its binding affinity to the lac<lb/> operator.<lb/> Positive regulation by CAP + cAMP<lb/> and the glucose effect</div>
