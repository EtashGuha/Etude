			<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Segmented line-source multi-tracer injection is
				suggested as an effective method for assessing groundwater<lb/> velocities and flow
				directions in subsurfaces characterized by high water flux. Modifying the common
				techniques<lb/> of injecting a tracer into a well became necessary after
				point-source natural and forced gradient tracer tests ended<lb/> with no reliable
				information on the local groundwater flow. The tracer's line-source increases the
				likelihood of<lb/> success of the test and could provide additional information
				regarding the lateral heterogeneity of the aquifer.<lb/> In a field experiment
				conducted in the northwestern part on the Dead Sea coast, tracers were injected
				into<lb/> an 8-m-long line injection system perpendicular to the assumed flow
				direction. The injection system was divided<lb/> into four separate segments with
				four different tracers. An array of five boreholes located within a 10 × 10 m
				area<lb/> downstream was used for monitoring the tracers' transport. Two dye tracers
				(uranine and Na naphthionate) were<lb/> injected in a long pulse of several hours
				into two of the injection pipe segments. Two other tracers (Rhenium<lb/> oxide and
				Gd-DTPA) were instantaneously injected into the other two segments. The tracers were
				detected 0.7 to<lb/> 2.3 h after injection in four of the five observation wells,
				located 2.3 to 10 m away from the injection system.<lb/> The groundwater velocity
				was determined to be ∼80 to 170 m/d, based on the recoveries of the tracers.
				The<lb/> groundwater flow direction was derived based on the arrival of the tracers
				and was found to be quite consistent<lb/> with the apparent direction of the
				hydraulic gradient.<lb/></div>
