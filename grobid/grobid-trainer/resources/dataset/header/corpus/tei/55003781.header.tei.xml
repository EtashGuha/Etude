	<div type="abstract">Abstract-An adaptive mean frequencjr estimator is proposed<lb/> for color flow imaging. It is based on a series expansion of the first<lb/> derivative of the autocorrelation function (of the Doppler signal at<lb/> origin. Its bias can he reduced by shifting the integration bounds<lb/> in the series expansion and its variance adjusted by adapting<lb/> the coefficients of the serial development. This estimator can be<lb/> fitted to the specific characteristics of the clutter rejection filter<lb/> using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of thie Doppler signal as an<lb/> adaptive parameter. Its performance is compared to that of the<lb/> usual correlation angle estimator, and its thresholded version,<lb/> as well as that of the general mean frequency estimator, using<lb/> a model of Doppler signal. The detection of low frequencies<lb/> was significantly improved. The mean square error (MSE) was<lb/> reduced an average 15 fold over a 25-dB range on the SNR,<lb/> compared to the correlation angle estimator (CAE) or the general<lb/> mean frequency estimator. A two-fold reduction in the MSE<lb/> was obtained compared to the thresholded correlation angle<lb/> estimator.<lb/></div>
