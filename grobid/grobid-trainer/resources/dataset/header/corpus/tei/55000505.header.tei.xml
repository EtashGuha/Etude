	Purpose The aim of this study was to identify tumor-specific methylation in bronchial lavage for the early<lb/> detection of non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by differentiating the age-related methylation from the<lb/> tumor-specific methylation in NSCLC.<lb/> Patients and Methods<lb/> Eighty-five NSCLC patients and 127 cancer-free subjects participated in this study. Aberrant methylation<lb/> at the promoters of the p16, Ras association domain family 1A (RASSF1A), fragile histidine triad (FHIT),<lb/> H-cadherin, and retinoic acid receptor ␤ (RAR␤) genes were evaluated in the resected tumor tissues and<lb/> bronchial lavage samples of NSCLC patients and in the bronchial lavage samples of cancer-free subjects<lb/> by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction.<lb/> Results Of the 127 cancer-free samples, methylation was detected in 6% for p16, 13% for RAR␤, 3% for<lb/> H-cadherin, 4% for RASSF1A, and 28% for FHIT. Hypermethylation of the p16, RAR␤, H-cadherin, and<lb/> RASSF1A genes was not associated with patient age and smoking, whereas hypermethylation of the<lb/> FHIT promoter occurred more frequently in older patients (P ϭ .02) and was associated with exposure<lb/> to tobacco smoke (P ϭ .001). A strong correlation between age and smoking was found in patients with<lb/> hypermethylation of the FHIT gene (r ϭ 0.36; P ϭ .03). A total of 68% of the bronchial lavage samples<lb/> from the 85 NSCLC patients showed methylation of at least one of p16, RAR␤, H-cadherin, and<lb/> RASSF1A genes.<lb/> Conclusion Our study suggests that tumor-specific methylation of the p16, RASSF1A, H-cadherin, and RAR␤ genes<lb/> may be a valuable biomarker for the early detection of NSCLC in bronchial lavage, and that the<lb/> age-related methylation of FHIT gene in the normal bronchial epithelium is related to the exposure to<lb/> tobacco smoke.<lb/></div>
