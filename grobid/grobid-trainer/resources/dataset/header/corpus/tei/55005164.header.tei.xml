			<div type="abstract"> a b s t r a c t<lb/> With increasing cost competition and product
				variety, providing an efficient just-in-time (JIT) supply has<lb/> become one of the
				greatest challenges in the use of mixed-model assembly line production systems.
				In<lb/> the present paper, therefore, we propose a new approach for scheduling JIT
				part supply from a central<lb/> storage center. Usually, materials are stored in
				boxes that are allotted to the consumptive stations of<lb/> the line by a forklift.
				For such a real-world problem, a new model, a complexity proof as well as
				different<lb/> exact and heuristic solution procedures are provided. Furthermore, a
				direct comparison with a simple<lb/> two-bin kanban system is provided. Such a
				system is currently applied in the real-world industrial pro-<lb/> cess that
				motivates our research. It becomes obvious that this policy is considerably
				outperformed<lb/> according to the resulting inventory- and a-service levels.
				Moreover, at the interface between logistics<lb/> and assembly operations, strategic
				management implications are obtained. Specifically, based on the<lb/> new approach,
				it is the first time a statistical analysis is being made as to whether widespread
				Level<lb/> Scheduling policies, which are well-known from the Toyota Production
				System, indeed facilitate material<lb/> supply. Note that in the literature it is
				frequently claimed that this causality exists.<lb/>
