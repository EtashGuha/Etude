		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The maximization of diversity of neuronal response properties has been recently suggested <lb/>as an organizing principle for the formation of such prominent features of the functional <lb/>architecture of the brain as the cortical columns and the associated patchy projection patterns <lb/>(Malach, 1994). We report a computational study of two aspects of this hypothesis. First, we <lb/>show that maximal diversity is attained when the ratio of dendritic and axonal arbor sizes is <lb/>equal to one, as it has been found in many cortical areas and across species (Lund et al., 1993; <lb/>Malach, 1994). Second, we show that maximization of diversity leads to better performance in <lb/>two case studies: in systems of receptive fields implementing steerable/shiftable filters, and in <lb/>matching spatially distributed signals, a problem that arises in visual tasks such as stereopsis, <lb/>motion processing, and recognition. <lb/></div>
