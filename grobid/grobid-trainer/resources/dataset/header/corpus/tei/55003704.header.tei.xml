	<div type="abstract">Abstract. In this paper we introduce a novel multi-functional digitizing pen for<lb/> the verification and identification of individuals by means of handwritten<lb/> signatures, text or figures (biometric smart pen, BiSP). Different from most<lb/> conventional graphics tablets the device measures the kinematics and the<lb/> dynamics of hand movement during the writing process by recording the<lb/> pressure (Px, Py, Pz) and inclination (α, β) of the pen. Characteristic behavioral<lb/> patterns are numerically extracted from the signals and stored in a database.<lb/> Biometric test samples are compared against reference templates using a rapid<lb/> feature classification and matching algorithm. A first BiSP prototype based on<lb/> pressure sensors is available for presentation. Preliminary results obtained from<lb/> 3D pressure signals demonstrate a remarkable potential of the system for<lb/> person verification and identification, and suggest further applications in the<lb/> areas of neurology and psychiatry.<lb/></div>
