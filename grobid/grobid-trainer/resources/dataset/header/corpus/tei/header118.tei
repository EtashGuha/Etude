		<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT <lb/>As network latency drops below disk latency, access time to a remote disk will begin <lb/>to approach local disk access time. The performance of I/O may then be improved <lb/>by spreading disk pages across several remote disk servers and accessing disk pages <lb/>in parallel. To research this we have prototyped a data page server called a Page <lb/>File. This persistent data type provides a set of methods to access disk pages stored <lb/>on a cluster of remote machines acting as disk servers. The goal is to improve the <lb/>throughput of database management system or other I/O intensive application by <lb/>accessing pages from remote disks and incurring disk latency in parallel. This report <lb/>describes the conceptual foundation and the methods of access for our prototype. <lb/></div>
