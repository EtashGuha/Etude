			<div type="abstract">a b s t r a c t<lb/> In February 2007, the U.S. Department of
				Energy, BP Exploration (Alaska), and the U.S. Geological Survey,<lb/> collected
				open-hole pressure-response data, as well as gas and water sample collection, in a
				gas hydrate<lb/> reservoir (the BPXA-DOE-USGS Mount Elbert Gas Hydrate Stratigraphic
				Test Well) using Schlumberger's<lb/> Modular Dynamics Formation Tester (MDT)
				wireline tool. Four such MDT tests, ranging from six to twelve<lb/> hours duration,
				and including a series of flow, sampling, and shut-in periods of various durations,
				were<lb/> conducted. Locations for the testing were selected based on NMR and other
				log data to assure sufficient<lb/> isolation from reservoir boundaries and zones of
				excess free water. Test stages in which pressure was<lb/> reduced sufficiently to
				mobilize free water in the formation (yet not cause gas hydrate dissociation)<lb/>
				produced readily interpretable pressure build-up profiles. Build-ups following
				larger drawdowns consis-<lb/> tently showed gas-hydrate dissociation and gas release
				(as confirmed by optical fluid analyzer data), as well<lb/> as progressive dampening
				of reservoir pressure build-up during sequential tests at a given MDT test
				station.<lb/> History matches of one multi-stage, 12-h test (the C2 test) were
				accomplished using five different<lb/> reservoir simulators:<lb/> CMG-STARS,<lb/>
				HydrateResSim,<lb/> MH21-HYDRES,<lb/> STOMP-HYD,<lb/> and TOUGH Ã¾ HYDRATE.
				Simulations utilized detailed information collected across the reservoir either<lb/>
				obtained or determined from geophysical well logs, including thickness (11.3 m, 37
				ft.), porosity (35%),<lb/> hydrate saturation (65%), both mobile and immobile water
				saturations, intrinsic permeability (1000 mD),<lb/> pore water salinity (5 ppt), and
				formation temperature (3.3e3.9 C). This paper will present the approach<lb/> and
				preliminary results of the history-matching efforts, including estimates of initial
				formation<lb/> permeability and analyses of the various unique features exhibited by
				the MDT results.<lb/></div>
