		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The role of the systems analyst in the implementation process has changed <lb/>dramatically in recent times because of changes to organisational boundaries, the <lb/>need to align IT with business objectives and the complexity of the systems now <lb/>required. Some organisations are finding themselves in a continually changing <lb/>environment and being involved in multi-organisational structures. Establishing <lb/>strategies and requirements for these organisations requires a new understanding <lb/>of the implementation process. Implementation is concerned with behavioural <lb/>phenomena since people are involved from the inception of the idea, as well as <lb/>being involved in the development process. They are also affected by the changes <lb/>which the new system brings to the organisation. The research is attempting to <lb/>understand the critical factors associated with the implementation process and <lb/>consequently develop an appropriate model. <lb/></div>
