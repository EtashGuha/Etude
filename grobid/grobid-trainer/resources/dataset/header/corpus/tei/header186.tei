		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Plan recognition is the process of observing another agent&apos;s behavior(s) and inferring what, and <lb/>possibly why, the agent is acting as it is. Plan recognition becomes a very important means of acquiring <lb/>such information about other agents in situations and domains where explicit communication is either <lb/>very costly, dangerous, or impossible. Performing plan recognition in a physical domain (i.e. the real <lb/>world) forces the world&apos;s ubiquitous uncertainty upon the observing agent because of the necessity to <lb/>use real sensors to make the observations. We have developed a multiple resolution, hierarchical plan <lb/>recognition system to coordinate the motion of two interacting mobile robots. Uncertainty arises in the <lb/>system from dead reckoning errors that accumulate while the robots are moving, as well as by errors <lb/>in the computer vision system that is used to detect the other agent&apos;s behaviors. Based upon belief <lb/>networks, the plan recognition system gracefully degrades in performance as the level of uncertainty <lb/>about observations increase. <lb/></div>
