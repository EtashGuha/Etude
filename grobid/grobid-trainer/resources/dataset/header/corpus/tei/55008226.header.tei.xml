	<div type="abstract">Abstract:<lb/> The field of obesity management is coming to appreciate the efficacy of pharmacological<lb/> treatments. For the past twenty years the thermogenic effects of sympathetic stimulation have<lb/> been known and described. Recent studies have demonstrated that treating patients with a<lb/> drug combination including the sympathomimetic ephedrine, the stimulant caffeine, and the<lb/> analgesic aspirin (ECA combination) will stimulate thermogenesis and result in lowered weight<lb/> but maintained muscle mass. This protein-sparing lipolysis has been attributed to the elevated<lb/> levels of cAMP generated by the ECA combination. In rat studies, the mechanism of action has<lb/> been well characterized in vitro and although there is some discrepancy in humans, a similar<lb/> mechanism seems to be active. Randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the<lb/> short-term efficacy of the ECA combination, but long-term studies are lacking. Most studies have<lb/> also demonstrated the incidence of short-term side effects associated with excessive sympathetic<lb/> stimulation, and have shown them to be transient and mild. Future studies should focus on<lb/> the long-term efficacy of the ECA combination, and the effects of stopping treatment on the<lb/> maintenance of fat loss.<lb/></div>
