			<div type="abstract">The ability to produce a diverse repertoire of fully human
				monoclonal<lb/> antibodies may have significant applications to human therapy. One
				of<lb/> the most promising approaches to the production of therapeutic human<lb/>
				monoclonal antibodies is the creation of a mouse strain engineered to produce<lb/> a
				large repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of mouse antibodies.<lb/>
				Recently, such mice have been generated by introducing segments of human<lb/>
				immunoglobulin loci into the germlines of mice deficient in mouse antibody<lb/>
				production as a result of gene targeting. These mice produce significant<lb/> levels
				of fully human antibodies with a diverse adult-like repertoire and,<lb/> upon
				immunization with antigens, generate antigen-specific fully human<lb/> monoclonal
				antibodies. Such strains of mice may provide the optimal source<lb/> for producing
				human monoclonal antibodies with high affinity and specificity<lb/> against a broad
				spectrum of antigens, including human antigens.<lb/></div>
