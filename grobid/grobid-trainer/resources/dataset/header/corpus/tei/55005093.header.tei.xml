			<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi died in 1926 aged
				74 when, at best, he had completed 10 percent of his magnum<lb/> opus, the Sagrada
				Familia Church, on which he had worked for 43 years. He left for his successors a
				conundrum that is<lb/> still being played out today. Given that the building is so
				manijestl-v a complex building task, it seems extraordinary that<lb/> he succeeded
				in leaving behind a codex s@cient!v comprehensive that his successors have been able
				to bring the project<lb/> signi$cantly forward towards conclusion with accuracy. The
				codex is based on second order surface geomety, and while<lb/> the geomety may be
				interpreted without the use of the computer, the demands today are tempered by
				expectations<lb/> racked-up to make the contribution of the computer non-negotiable.
				Professor Mark Burry has been working on the<lb/> project since 1979 both pre and
				post digitalcv. His lecture will look at the implications of introducing the
				computer to<lb/> assist solving the underlying geometry that regulates the entire
				unbuilt sections. In doing so he will discuss the gains and<lb/> potential losses
				that have resultedfrom more than ten years use of high end aeronautical design
				sofiare to aid the task<lb/> of completion of a building too demanding for software
				designed for the architecture sector.<lb/>
