			<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> Local number portability (LNP) is a key factor in the
				promotion of local call competition<lb/> in telecommunications. By allowing a
				consumer to retain their number when moving<lb/> between local telephone providers,
				LNP reduces customers' switching costs and makes it<lb/> easier for new providers to
				compete for customers. But regulators face a number of<lb/> important choices when
				implementing LNP — what technology should be chosen, what are<lb/> the costs of
				implementing LNP and who should pay? This paper considers how the<lb/> regulator can
				implement LNP when there is asymmetric information about the optimal<lb/> timing,
				choice and cost of technology and about the value of LNP to individual
				customers.<lb/> We show that requiring each carrier to bear their own costs and
				creating transferable<lb/> ownership of telephone numbers may allow the regulator to
				overcome the problems created<lb/> by asymmetric information. © 2001 Elsevier
