		<div type="abstract">Abstract: The learning web was presented [Norrie and Gaines, 1995] at EdMedia95 <lb/>as a systemic approach to the modeling and support of knowledge processes in a <lb/>learning society. This article addresses the rationale for, and systemic foundations of, <lb/>the learning web, its implications for restructuring the higher education system, and <lb/>the role of information technology in supporting that restructuring. Two associated <lb/>articles report on the implementation of some of the technologies necessary to <lb/>support the learning web [Gaines and Shaw, 1996], and some preliminary experience <lb/>in applying them in undergraduate education [Shaw and Gaines, 1996]. <lb/></div>
