	<div type="abstract">General considerations: All reactions were carried out under a dry argon or nitrogen<lb/> atmosphere, using standard Schlenk and glovebox techniques. Non-halogenated solvents were<lb/> distilled over sodium benzophenone ketyl and halogenated solvents over P 2 O 5 . Diglyme was<lb/> dried over molecular sieves. Deuterated solvents were obtained from Cambridge Isotope<lb/> Laboratories and stored over molecular sieves. All chemicals were purchased from<lb/> commercial sources in purities &gt; 97% and used without further purification if not otherwise<lb/> mentioned in the synthetic procedure. NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian INOVA<lb/> 400 spectrometer at 300 K. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to the deuterated<lb/> solvent. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario elementar EL III. GC analyses were<lb/> performed on an Agilent 6890N Network GC-System equipped with a HP-5 column (30 m ×<lb/> 0.32 µm × 0.25 µm) and GC-MS analyses on a Thermo Focus GC with a DSQ MS-unit<lb/> equipped with a HP-5-MS column (30 m × 0.32 µm × 0.25 µm). Flash chromatography was<lb/> performed over SiO 2 60 (0.040-0.063 mm) from Merck and all used solvents freshly distilled<lb/> prior to use.</div>
