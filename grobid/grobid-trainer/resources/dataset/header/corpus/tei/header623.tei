		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In comparision with other games, particularly chess, the research in computer bridge is <lb/>immature, and the best bridge-playing programs are mediocre. We propose to study the <lb/>automation of the card-playing segment of bridge (omitting bidding), using a number of <lb/>different techniques. In this paper we first give an introduction to the state of computer <lb/>bridge. Next, we propose two possible architectures for solving double-dummy bridge <lb/>(i.e., a simplified bridge game with perfect information): The first is based on the <lb/>combination of And-OR search and heuristic evaluation. The second forms a global plan <lb/>by merging subplans for each individual suit. Next, to deal with uncertain information in <lb/>real bridge, we present a new mechanism that combines the concepts of both minimax <lb/>search and possible worlds. Finally we give a brief description of further work toward <lb/>automating card-playing in real bridge. <lb/></div>
