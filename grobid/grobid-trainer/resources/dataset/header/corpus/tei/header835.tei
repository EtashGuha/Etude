		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We present a computational model of how verbs might be learned within <lb/>the limited domain of hand actions. We hypothesize that such verbs refer to <lb/>the activities of underlying motor schemas, and leverage this constraint to <lb/>build a system with strong enough biases that it can learn from a reasonably <lb/>small number of examples, while still having adequate flexibility to learn the <lb/>hand-action verbs of any language. The completed system should demonstrate its knowledge both by labelling its own behavior and by carrying out <lb/>verbal commands in a simulated world. <lb/></div>
