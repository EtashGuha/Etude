		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In this position paper we raise the question of whether Configuration Management (CM) <lb/>research has a future. The new standard in CM systems|typified by commercial products <lb/>such as Adele, ADC, ClearCase, Continuus/CM, and CCC/Harvest|largely satisfies the CM <lb/>functionality requirements posed by Dart. This implies that research in the area of CM is either <lb/>unnecessary or that we must find new challenges in CM on which to focus. We believe that <lb/>these challenges indeed exist. Here we present some areas that we feel are good opportunities <lb/>for new or continued CM research, and therefore conclude that CM research does have a future. <lb/></div>
