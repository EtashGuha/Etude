		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Recent advances in the Domain Name System (DNS) and the Dynamic Host Configuration <lb/>Protocol (DHCP) have enabled a new approach to supporting mobile users: location independent <lb/>naming. In this approach, machines use the same hostname from any internet location, but use an <lb/>IP address that corresponds to their current location. We describe a protocol that implements <lb/>location independent naming for nomadic computers, i.e., machines that do not need transparent <lb/>mobility. Our protocol allows hosts to move across security domains, uses existing protocols, and <lb/>preserves existing trust relationships. Therefore, it preserves the performance and security of <lb/>normal IP for nomadic computers at the expense of not providing the transparent mobility of <lb/>Mobile IP. We contend that this is a reasonable tradeoff for nomadic computing. <lb/></div>
