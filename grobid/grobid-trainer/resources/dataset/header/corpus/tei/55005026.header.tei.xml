			<div type="abstract">Abstract-The road to 3G runs through 2G and 2.5G<lb/> networks.
				Until 3G is deployed ubiquitously, 2-2.5G networks<lb/> and endpoints will dominate.
				The 3G subscribers should<lb/> share the successful services deployed in the
				existing network<lb/> and the service migration is needed. Redesigning and<lb/>
				redeveloping the legacy services is a time-consuming and<lb/> error-prone task. A
				Connection View Model (CVM)<lb/> approach is taken to simplify the service
				migration. Services<lb/> represented with the CVM are platform independent and
				the<lb/> main task is to develop the transform rules for service<lb/> migration
				which can be reused. With this approach, the<lb/> successful Color Ring Back Tone
				(CRBT) service is migrated<lb/> to the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).<lb/></div>
