			<div type="abstract">An experimental method is described which allows the determination of the diffusion coeffi- <lb/>cient D of an aromatic hydrocarbon in its lowest and metastable triplet state T\ with an absolute <lb/>accuracy of ±5%. D was determined at 25 °C. With anthracene the temperature-dependence <lb/>of D was measured from 0°C to 00°C in hexane and from 20°C to 89°C in hexadecane ; it was <lb/>found to be in good but not perfect agreement with the Stokes-Einstein equation. With the <lb/>investigated systems, D of molecules in Ti is estimated to be at most 10% smaller than D of <lb/>molecule« in the ground state. No evidence for the formation of triplet excimers was found. <lb/>Some applications of the method are proposed, and in this connection some questions concerning <lb/>the kinetics of diffusion-controlled reactions of molecules in T\ and the existence of triplet <lb/>excimers are discussed.<lb/></div>
