		<div type="abstract">Abstract. This paper presents Kenmore, a general framework for knowledge acquisition for natural language processing (NLP) systems. To ease <lb/>the acquisition of knowledge in new domains, Kenmore exploits an online corpus using robust sentence analysis and embedded symbolic machine learning techniques while requiring only minimal human intervention. By treating all problems in ambiguity resolution as classification <lb/>tasks, the framework uniformly addresses a range of subproblems in sentence analysis, each of which traditionally had required a separate computational mechanism. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the <lb/>successful use of Kenmore for learning solutions to several problems in <lb/>lexical and structural ambiguity resolution. We argue that the learning <lb/>and knowledge acquisition components should be embedded components <lb/>of the NLP system in that (1) learning should take place within the <lb/>larger natural language understanding system as it processes text, and <lb/>(2) the learning components should be evaluated in the context of prac <lb/>tical language-processing tasks. <lb/></div>
