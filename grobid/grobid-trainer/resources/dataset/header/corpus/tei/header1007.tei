		<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/>   We argue that if color-superconducting quark matter exists in the core of a neutron star, it<lb/> may contain a high density of flux tubes, carrying flux that is mostly color-magnetic, with a small<lb/> admixture of ordinary magnetic flux. We focus on the two-flavor color-superconducting ( " 2SC " )<lb/> phase, and assume that the flux tubes are energetically stable, although this has not yet been<lb/> demonstrated. The density of flux tubes depends on the nature of the transition to the color-<lb/> superconducting phase, and could be within an order of magnitude of the density of magnetic flux<lb/>  tubes that would be found if the core were superconducting nuclear matter. We calculate the cross-<lb/>  section for Aharonov-Bohm scattering of gapless fermions off the flux tubes, and the associated<lb/>  collision time and frictional force on a moving flux tube. We discuss the other forces on the flux<lb/>  tube, and find that if we take in to account only the forces that arise within the 2SC core region<lb/>  then the timescale for expulsion of the color flux tubes from the 2SC core is of order 10   10   years.<lb/></div>
