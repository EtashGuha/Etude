		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Standard safety analysis techniques are often ineffective when computers and digital devices are integrated into plant control. The Safeware methodology and its <lb/>set of supporting safety analysis techniques (and prototype tools) includes modeling <lb/>and hazard analysis of complex systems where the components may be a mixture of <lb/>humans, hardware, and software. This paper describes one of the Safeware hazard <lb/>analysis techniques, Software Deviation Analysis, that incorporates the beneficial features of HAZOP (such as guidewords, deviations, exploratory analysis, and a systems <lb/>engineering approach) into an automated procedure that is capable of handling the <lb/>complexity and logical nature of computer software. <lb/></div>
