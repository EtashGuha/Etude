	<div type="abstract">The large scale and profitable deployment of Ethernet services requires Ethernet<lb/> technologies to support carrier grade capabilities, which include scalability, resiliency, traffic<lb/> engineering, QoS, and OAM (operation, administration and maintenance). Provider<lb/> Backbone Bridges (PBB) and Provider Backbone Bridge Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE) are<lb/> the emerging technology solutions for Carrier Grade Ethernet. PBB introduces the hierarchy<lb/> within service providers&apos; backbone Ethernet networks, provides Ethernet address space<lb/> separation between customer domain and backbone domain and supports the scalability<lb/> requirement of carrier deployment of Ethernet. PBB-TE introduces traffic engineering,<lb/> connection oriented forwarding model, OAM and protection switching capabilities into carrier<lb/> Ethernet networks.<lb/></div>
