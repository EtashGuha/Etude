		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In this paper, we propose a definition of goal achievability: given a basic action theory describing an initial state of the world and some primitive actions available to a <lb/>robot, including some actions which return binary sensing information, what goals can <lb/>be achieved by the robot? The main technical result of the paper is a proof that a simple <lb/>robot programming language is universal, in that any effectively achievable goal can be <lb/>achieved by getting the robot to execute one of the robot programs. The significance of <lb/>this result is at least two fold. First, it is in many ways similar to the equivalence theorem between Turing machines and recursive functions, but applied to robots whose <lb/>actions are specified by an action theory. Secondly, it provides formal justifications for <lb/>using the simple robot programming language as a foundation for our work on robotics. <lb/></div>
