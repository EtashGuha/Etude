The annual UK cost was estimated at £17m<lb/> in 1994 [2]. Foot ulceration in diabetes has been associated<lb/> with higher mortality [3] and reduced quality of life [4 – 6].<lb/> Infection and foot ulceration in diabetes<lb/> People with diabetes are particularly susceptible to foot infection<lb/> [7,8]. Infection in foot ulcers may be polymicrobial [9,10] and both<lb/> the number of bacterial groups and bacterial density is thought<lb/> to affect healing. High cell density can lead to alterations in colony<lb/> behaviour through messaging and by their secreting a protective<lb/> Correspondence to :</div>
