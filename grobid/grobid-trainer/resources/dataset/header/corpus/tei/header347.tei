		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>A new generation of sensor rich, massively distributed <lb/>autonomous systems is being developed that has <lb/>the potential for unprecedented performance, such <lb/>as smart buildings, reconfigurable factories, adaptive <lb/>traffic systems and remote earth ecosystem monitoring. To achieve high performance these massive systems will need to accurately model themselves and <lb/>their environment from sensor information. Accomplishing this on a grand scale requires automating the <lb/>art of large-scale modeling. This paper presents a <lb/>formalization of decompositional, model-based learning <lb/>(DML), a method developed by observing a modeler&apos;s <lb/>expertise at decomposing large scale model estimation <lb/>tasks. The method exploits a striking analogy between <lb/>learning and consistency-based diagnosis. Moriarty, <lb/>an implementation of DML, has been applied to thermal modeling of a smart building, demonstrating a <lb/>significant improvement in learning rate. <lb/></div>
