		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We describe an integrated problem solving architecture named INBANCA in <lb/>which Bayesian networks and case-based reasoning (CBR) work cooperatively on <lb/>multiagent planning tasks. This includes two-team dynamic tasks, and this paper <lb/>concentrates on simulated soccer as an example. Bayesian networks are used to characterize action selection whereas a case-based approach is used to determine how to <lb/>implement actions. This paper has two contributions. First, we survey integrations <lb/>of case-based and Bayesian approaches from the perspective of a popular CBR task <lb/>decomposition framework, thus explaining what types of integrations have been attempted. This allows us to explain the unique aspects of our proposed integration. <lb/>Second, we demonstrate how Bayesian nets can be used to provide environmental <lb/>context, and thus feature selection information, for the case-based reasoner. <lb/></div>
