		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In this paper we show that application-aware adaptation, a <lb/>collaborative partnership between the operating system and <lb/>applications, offers the most general and effective approach <lb/>to mobile information access. We describe the design of <lb/>Odyssey, a prototype implementing this approach, and show <lb/>how it supports concurrent execution of diverse mobile applications. We identify agility as a key attribute of adaptive systems, and describe how to quantify and measure it. <lb/>We present the results of our evaluation of Odyssey, indicating performance improvements up to a factor of 5 on a <lb/>benchmark of three applications concurrently using remote <lb/>services over a network with highly variable bandwidth. <lb/></div>
