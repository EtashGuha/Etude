	<div type="abstract">Scope<lb/> This Recommendation specifies audio measurement algorithms for the purpose of determining subjective<lb/> programme loudness, and true-peak signal level.<lb/></div>
<div type ="introduction"> The ITU Radiocommunication Assembly,<lb/> considering<lb/> a)<lb/> that modern digital sound transmission techniques offer an extremely wide dynamic range;<lb/> b)<lb/> that modern digital sound production and transmission techniques provide a mixture of<lb/> mono, stereo and multichannel formats and that sound programmes are produced in all of these<lb/> formats;<lb/> c)<lb/> that listeners desire the subjective loudness of audio programmes to be uniform for different<lb/> sources and programme types;<lb/> d)<lb/> that many methods are available for measurement of audio levels but that existing<lb/> measurement methods employed in programme production do not provide indication of subjective<lb/> loudness;<lb/> e)<lb/> that, for the purpose of programme exchange, it is essential to have a single recommended<lb/> algorithm for objective estimation of subjective loudness;<lb/> f)<lb/> that future complex algorithms based on psychoacoustic models may provide improved<lb/> objective measures of loudness for a wide variety of audio programmes;<lb/> g)<lb/> that digital media overload abruptly, and thus even momentary overload should be avoided,<lb/> considering further<lb/> h)<lb/> that peak signal levels may increase due to commonly applied processes such as filtering or<lb/> bit-rate reduction;<lb/> j)<lb/> that existing metering technologies do not reflect the true-peak level contained in a digital<lb/> signal since the true-peak value may occur in between samples;<lb/> k)<lb/> that the state of digital signal processing makes it practical to implement an algorithm that<lb/> closely estimates the true-peak level of a signal;<lb/> l)<lb/> that use of a true-peak indicating algorithm will allow accurate indication of the headroom<lb/> between the peak level of a digital audio signal and the clipping level,</div>
