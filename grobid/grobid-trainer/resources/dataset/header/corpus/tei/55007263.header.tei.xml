	<div type="abstract">Abstract. In this paper we present a very practical ciphertext-only cryptanalysis of GSM encrypted<lb/> communication, and various active attacks on the GSM protocols. These attacks can even break into<lb/> GSM networks that use &quot;unbreakable&quot; ciphers. We first describe a ciphertext-only attack on A5/2 that<lb/> requires a few dozen milliseconds of encrypted off-the-air cellular conversation and finds the correct key<lb/> in less than a second on a personal computer. We extend this attack to a (more complex) ciphertext-<lb/>only attack on A5/1. We then describe new (active) attacks on the protocols of networks that use<lb/> A5/1, A5/3, or even GPRS. These attacks exploit flaws in the GSM protocols, and they work whenever<lb/> the mobile phone supports a weak cipher such as A5/2. We emphasize that these attacks are on the<lb/> protocols, and are thus applicable whenever the cellular phone supports a weak cipher, for example,<lb/> they are also applicable for attacking A5/3 networks using the cryptanalysis of A5/1. Unlike previous<lb/> attacks on GSM that require unrealistic information, like long known plaintext periods, our attacks<lb/> are very practical and do not require any knowledge of the content of the conversation. Furthermore,<lb/> we describe how to fortify the attacks to withstand reception errors. As a result, our attacks allow<lb/> attackers to tap conversations and decrypt them either in real-time, or at any later time. We present<lb/> several attack scenarios such as call hijacking, altering of data messages and call theft.<lb/></div>
