	<div type="abstract">An example of the Michaelis-Menten saturation curve of an irreversible enzyme reaction.<lb/> In biochemistry, Michaelis–Menten<lb/> kinetics is one of the simplest and<lb/> best-known models of enzyme<lb/> kinetics. It is named after American<lb/> biochemist Leonor Michaelis and<lb/> Canadian physician Maud Menten. The<lb/> model takes the form of an equation<lb/> describing the rate of enzymatic<lb/> reactions, by relating reaction rate<lb/> to , the concentration of a<lb/> substrate S. Its formula is given by<lb/> Here,<lb/> represents the maximum rate achieved by the system, at maximum (saturating) substrate concentrations.<lb/> The Michaelis constant<lb/> is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of<lb/> . Single<lb/> substrate biochemical reactions are often assumed to follow Michaelis–Menten kinetics, without regard to the<lb/> model&apos;s underlying assumptions.<lb/> Model<lb/> A model of one of the most basic enzymatic reactions was first proposed by American biochemist Leonor Michaelis<lb/> and Canadian physician Maud Menten in 1913.<lb/> [1] It involves an enzyme E reversibly binding to a substrate S to form<lb/> a complex ES, which in turn is converted into a product P and the enzyme. This may be represented schematically as<lb/> where ,<lb/> and denote the rate constants of the three reactions. Under certain assumptions – such as the<lb/> enzyme concentration being much less than the substrate concentration – the rate of product formation is given by<lb/> The reaction rate increases with increasing substrate concentration<lb/> ], asymptotically approaching its maximum<lb/> rate , attained when all enzyme is bound to substrate. We can also write<lb/> , where<lb/> is the turnover number and<lb/> is the enzyme concentration.<lb/> The Michaelis constant<lb/> is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is at half-maximum, and is a<lb/> measure of the substrate&apos;s affinity for the enzyme. A small<lb/> indicates high affinity, meaning that the rate will<lb/> approach more quickly.<lb/> [2]<lb/> The model is used in a variety of biochemical situations other than enzyme substrate interaction, including<lb/> antigen-antibody binding, DNA hybridisation and protein-protein interaction.<lb/> [2] [3] It can be used to characterise a<lb/> generic biochemical reaction, in the same way that the Langmuir equation can be used to model generic adsorption</div>
