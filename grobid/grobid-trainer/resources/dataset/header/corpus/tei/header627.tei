		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>A key question in conditional planning is: how many, <lb/>and which of the possible execution failures should be <lb/>planned for? One cannot, in general, plan for all the <lb/>possible failures because the search space is too large. <lb/>One cannot ignore all the possible failures, or one will <lb/>fail to produce sufficiently flexible plans. In this paper, <lb/>we describe an approach to conditional planning that <lb/>attempts to identify the contingencies that contribute <lb/>the most to a plan&apos;s overall utility. Plan generation <lb/>proceeds by handling the most important contingencies first, extending the plan to include actions that <lb/>will be taken in case the contingency fails. We discuss <lb/>the representational issues that must be addressed in <lb/>order to implement such an algorithm, and present an <lb/>example which illustrates our approach. <lb/></div>
