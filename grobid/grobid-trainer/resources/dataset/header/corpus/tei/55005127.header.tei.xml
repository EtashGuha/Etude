			<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> This paper presents an evaluation of the 1984–1996
				Australian Passenger Motor Vehicle Plan. The basic approach adopted for<lb/> data
				gathering was interviews with senior managers of companies immediately affected by
				the industry plan about the history of<lb/> development, implementation and content
				of the plan. Additionally, a discussion forum was held comprising industry
				representation<lb/> and managers from supplier companies to the automotive
				manufacturers. Based on these interviews, the paper isolates the critical<lb/>
				success factors and impediments to their success. Finally, the paper presents a
				framework for the successful development and<lb/> implementation of industry plans.
