	<div type="abstract">Abstract. Component-and normwise perturbation bounds for the block LU factorization and<lb/> block LDL * factorization of Hermitian matrices are presented. We also obtain, as a consequence,<lb/> perturbation bounds for the usual pointwise LU, LDL * , and Cholesky factorizations. Some of these<lb/> latter bounds are already known, but others improve previous results. All the bounds presented are<lb/> easily proved by using series expansions. Given a square matrix A = LU having the LU factorization,<lb/> and a perturbation E, the LU factors of the matrix A + E =<lb/> L<lb/> U are written as two convergent series<lb/> of matrices:<lb/> L =<lb/> ∞<lb/> k=0<lb/> L k and<lb/> U =<lb/> ∞<lb/> k=0<lb/> U k , where L k = O(E k ), U k = O(E k ), and L 0 = L,<lb/> U 0 = U . We present expressions for the matrices L k and U k in terms of L, U , and E. The domain<lb/> and the rate of convergence of these series are studied. Simple bounds on the remainders of any<lb/> order of these series are found, which significantly improve the bounds on the second-order terms<lb/> existing in the literature. This is useful when first-order perturbation analysis is used.<lb/></div>
