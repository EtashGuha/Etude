		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper describes DIDO, a system we have <lb/>developed to carry out exploratory learning of <lb/>unfamiliar domains without assistance from an <lb/>external teacher. The program incorporates novel <lb/>approaches to experience generation and representation <lb/>generation. The experience generator uses a heuristic <lb/>based on Shannon&apos;s uncertainty function to find <lb/>informative examples. The representation generator <lb/>makes conjectures on the basis of small amounts of <lb/>evidence and retracts them if they prove to be wrong <lb/>or useless. A number of experiments are described <lb/>which demonstrate that the system can distribute its <lb/>learning resources to steadily acquire a good <lb/>representation of the whole of a domain, and that the <lb/>system can readily acquire both disjunctive and <lb/>conjunctive concepts even in the presence of noise. <lb/></div>
