			<div type="abstract">Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is one of the rate-limiting en-<lb/>zymes in
				the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins<lb/> and other eicosanoids.
				Recent studies have shown enhanced<lb/> expression of COX-2 in cancer cells of
				several tissues. We<lb/> investigated the expression of COX-2 and prostaglandin
				(PG)<lb/> E<lb/> 2<lb/> production in two human skin epidermal cancer cell
				lines:<lb/> cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, HSC-5, and eccrine car-<lb/>cinoma,
				EcCa. Both COX-2 expression and PGE<lb/> 2<lb/> production were significantly
				enhanced in cancer cell lines compared<lb/> with the non-tumorigenic human
				keratinocyte cell line,<lb/> HaCaT. In order to determine the role of COX-2 in
				the<lb/> proliferation of HSC-5 and EcCa, the growth of untreated<lb/> cells and
				cells transfected with COX-2 antisense oligonucle-<lb/>otide was compared using the
				MTT assay. Transfection with<lb/> the antisense oligonucleotide suppressed COX-2
				protein ex-<lb/>pression and significantly inhibited cell growth. The effect of<lb/>
				a selective inhibitor of COX-2, NS398, was compared with<lb/> the effect of the
				antisense oligonucleotide in order to see<lb/> whether COX-2 expression and
				prostaglandins have selec-<lb/>tive effects on cell growth. COX-2 expression was
				unchanged<lb/> by NS398 treatment, whereas NS398 inhibited cell growth to<lb/> a
				certain extent. The degree of growth inhibition was greater<lb/> with the antisense
				oligonucleotide than with NS398. Our<lb/> findings indicate that COX-2 protein
				expression is enhanced<lb/> in skin epidermal cancer cells and that COX-2 plays a
				pivotal<lb/> role in regulating cell growth. Furthermore, inhibition of<lb/> COX-2
				expression had a more significant effect on growth<lb/> suppression than inhibition
				of COX-2 catalytic activity, sug-<lb/>gesting the existence of two different signal
				pathways via<lb/> COX-2 in regulating cell growth.</div>
