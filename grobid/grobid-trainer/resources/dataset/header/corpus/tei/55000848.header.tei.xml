	<div type="abstract">As part of a field experiment in a large U.S. city, the background music (classical versus<lb/> Top-Forty) in a centrally located wine store was varied over a two month period. The<lb/> results of an ANOVA indicated that the classical music influenced shoppers to spend<lb/> more money. Additional findings suggest that, rather than increasing the amount of wine<lb/> purchased, customers selected more expensive merchandise when classical music was<lb/> played in the background. MacInnis and Park&apos;s (1991) notion that music is more<lb/> persuasive when it &quot;fits&quot; the persuasion context is employed to account for these results.<lb/></div>
