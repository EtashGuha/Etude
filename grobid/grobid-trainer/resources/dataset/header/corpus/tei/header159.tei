		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper presents the Plannett system, which <lb/>combines artificial neural networks to achieve expert- <lb/>level accuracy on the difficult scientific task of recognizing volcanos in radar images of the surface of the <lb/>planet Venus. Plannett uses ANNs that vary along <lb/>two dimensions: the set of input features used to train <lb/>and the number of hidden units. The ANNs are combined simply by averaging their output activations. <lb/>When Plannett is used as the classification module <lb/>of a three-stage image analysis system called JAR- <lb/>tool, the end-to-end accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) is as good as that of a human planetary geologist on a four-image test suite. JARtool-Plannett <lb/>also achieves the best algorithmic accuracy on these <lb/>images to date. <lb/></div>
