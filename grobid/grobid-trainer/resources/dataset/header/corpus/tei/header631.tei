		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper describes network services to support <lb/>large multi-user virtual environments. A client-server design is proposed in which multiple servers <lb/>coordinate execution, manage communication, offload processing, and provide persistent storage for <lb/>their clients. Using this design, it is possible to support real-time features, such as collision detection, <lb/>voice bridging, persistent updates, physical simulation, and autonomous agents, that would be difficult to implement for large virtual environments <lb/>with a peer-to-peer design. The paper includes a <lb/>description of services being implemented in RING, <lb/>a client-server system for interaction between many <lb/>users in large virtual environments. <lb/></div>
