			<div type="abstract">
				An autotransformer (sometimes called autoformer) [1] is an electrical transformer with
				only one winding.<lb/> The auto prefix refers to the single coil rather than any
				automatic mechanism. In an autotransformer portions<lb/> of the same winding act as
				both the primary and secondary. The winding has at least three taps where<lb/>
				electrical connections are made. An autotransformer can be smaller, lighter and
				cheaper than a standard<lb/> dual-winding transformer however the autotransformer
				does not provide electrical isolation.<lb/> Autotransformers are often used to step
				up or down between voltages in the 110-117-120 volt range and<lb/> voltages in the
				220-230-240 volt range, e.g., to output either 110 or 120V (with taps) from 230V
				input,<lb/> allowing equipment from a 100 or 120V region to be used in a 230V
				region.<lb/></div>
