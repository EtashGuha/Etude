	<keyword>Chloroplasts, CF 0 CF,, Light Triggered ATPase Activity, Regulation. Mechanism of Inactivation<lb/></keyword>

	<div type="abstract">It has been found that the decay of light triggered ATPase activity is paralleled by non-<lb/>exchangeable type of binding of one ADP per mol of CF,. Inactivation of light triggered ATPase<lb/> activity is a continuous process. It can be described mathematically as shown in this paper. Three<lb/> simplified reaction schemes are described, each of them describing the mode of ATPase inactiva-<lb/>tion in a mechanistic way. A computer simulation of each model was performed and the results<lb/> were compared to the observed experimental data.<lb/> In the presence of phosphate our results were explained best by a model assuming that there is<lb/> at first a rapid binding of ADP to "exchangeable" sites. Due to a slowly occurring change in the<lb/> CF, protein with prolonged incubation, an increasing portion of the nucleotides can be found<lb/> bound in a non-exchangeable way after some seconds of incubation. Our model does not rule out<lb/> that this reaction sequence might be a part of a catalytic cycle in vivo. — Another result was the<lb/> finding that there is an additional diminution of ATPase activity when phosphate is lacking.</div>
