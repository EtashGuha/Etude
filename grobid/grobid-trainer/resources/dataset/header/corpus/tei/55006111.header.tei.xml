	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> A multi-layer a-Si:H based thermal neutron detector was<lb/> designed, fabricated and simulated by Monte Carlo method.<lb/> The detector consists of two a-Si:H pin detectors prepared by<lb/> plasma enhancd chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and<lb/> interfaced with coated layers of Gd, as a thermal neutron<lb/> converter. Simulation results indicate that a detector consisting<lb/> of 2 Gd films with thicknesses of 2 and 4 pm, sandwiched<lb/> properly with two layers of sufficiently thick (-30pm)<lb/> amorphous silicon diodes, has the optimum parameters. The<lb/> detectors have an intrinsic efficiency of about 42% at a<lb/> threshold setting of 7000 electrons, with an expected average<lb/> signal size of -12000 electrons which is well above the noise.<lb/> This efficiency will be further increased to nearly 63%, if we<lb/> use Gd with 50% enrichment in 157Gd. We can fabricate<lb/> position sensitive detectors with spatial resolution of 300 pm<lb/> with gamma sensitivity of -lxlO-&apos;? These detectors are highly<lb/> radiation resistant and are good candidates for use in various<lb/> application, where high efficiency, high resolution, gamma<lb/> insensitive position sensitive neutron detectors are needed.<lb/></div>
