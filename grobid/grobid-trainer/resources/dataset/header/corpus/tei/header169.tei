		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This article studies the following question: &quot;When is it possible to decide, on the basis of images of point features observed by an imprecisely modeled two-camera stereo <lb/>vision system, whether or not a prescribed robot positioning task has been accomplished with precision?&quot; It is shown that for a stereo vision system with known epipo-lar geometry, whether or not such a positioning task has been accomplished can be <lb/>decided with available data, just in case the task function which specifies the task is a <lb/>projective invariant. <lb/></div>
