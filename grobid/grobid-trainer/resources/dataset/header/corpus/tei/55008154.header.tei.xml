	<div type="abstract">Abstract. Mobile IP gets its firm position as a layer-3 mobility protocol for the<lb/> 3rd generation and beyond the 3rd generation communication system. Never-<lb/>theless, due to the security defects caused by adapting MIP for real service,<lb/> several systems such as AAA infrastructure have been introduced. On the other<lb/> hand, PKI infrastructure is considered to be a core standard infrastructure to<lb/> handle the authentication and secure channel for the present and future network.<lb/> In this paper, we suggest a secure registration scheme with authentication using<lb/> PKI infrastructure. Suggested scheme produces less static key management<lb/> overhead compared with legacy scheme and supports the previously deployed<lb/> standard authentication infrastructure. Especially, it has a feature that supports<lb/> mobile communication system. Secure re-distribution of dynamic session key<lb/> using asymmetric key and the optimized authentication roundtrip time for<lb/> handoffs shows such a feature.<lb/></div>
