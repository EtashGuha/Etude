	9.1.1.2<lb/> Multiplexing including reference signal structure<lb/> 9.1.1.2.1<lb/> Uplink reference-signal structure<lb/> As indicated in Section 9.1.1, uplink reference signals are transmitted within the two short blocks, which are time-<lb/>multiplexed with long blocks. Uplink reference signals are received and used at the Node B for the following two<lb/> purposes:<lb/> -Uplink channel estimation for uplink coherent demodulation/detection<lb/> -Possible uplink channel-quality estimation for uplink frequency-and/or time-domain channel-dependent<lb/> scheduling<lb/> It should be also considered a UE transmitting reference signal without data transmission for the use of uplink channel-<lb/>quality estimation. In this case, time interval of a reference signal transmission of a UE can be larger than one sub-<lb/>frame so that reference signals from multiple UEs can be multiplexed orthogonally in time domain.<lb/> Provided that uplink transmissions are received in a time-aligned fashion (within the cyclic-prefix tolerance), multiple<lb/> mutually orthogonal reference signals can be created. Multiple such mutually orthogonal uplink reference signals can be<lb/> allocated to<lb/> -A single multi-transmit-antenna UE to support e.g. uplink multi-layer transmission (MIMO)<lb/> -Different UEs within the same Node B<lb/> As shown in Figure 9.1.1.2.1-1, the uplink reference-signal structure should allow for:<lb/> -Localized reference signals occupying a continuous spectrum.<lb/> -Distributed reference signals occupying a comb-shaped spectrum.<lb/> Note that, due to the use of the short block for the transmission of reference-signals, the &quot;sub-carrier bandwidth&quot;, is<lb/> twice the &quot;sub-carrier bandwidth&quot; for data transmission in long blocks.</div>
