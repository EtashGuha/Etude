	<div type="abstract">Abstract:<lb/> The spread of high bandwidth network brings about the increasing number of network enabled<lb/> devices, which are directly attached to network or which are attached to network available computers. However<lb/> there is a big dierence between access methods to devices bey ond network and to devices directly attached<lb/> to local computers. Therefore users cannot access both kinds of devices by an unied method. To s o l v e t h i s<lb/> issue, we propose an extended access model for remote devices that preserves the device access semantics. In<lb/> our system, we extend USB driver stack o f L i n ux which is one of the most popular operating systems and design<lb/> device access method over network via the existing device le semantics. In this paper, we describe the design<lb/> of our system and a prototype implementation.<lb/></div>
