			<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has become a
				standard<lb/> technique used in a number of nonlinear estimation and ma-<lb/> chine
				learning applications. These include estimating the<lb/> state of a nonlinear
				dynamic system, estimating parame-<lb/> ters for nonlinear system identification
				(e.g., learning the<lb/> weights of a neural network), and dual estimation (e.g.,
				the<lb/> Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) where both states<lb/> and
				parameters are estimated simultaneously.<lb/> This paper points out the flaws in
				using the EKF, and<lb/> introduces an improvement, the Unscented Kalman Filter<lb/>
				(UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman [SJ. A central and<lb/> vital operation
				performed in the Kalman Filter is the prop-<lb/> agation of a Gaussian random
				variable (GRV) through the<lb/> system dynamics. In the EKF, the state distribution
				is ap-<lb/> proximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analyti-<lb/> cally
				through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear<lb/> system. This can
				introduce large errors in the true posterior<lb/> mean and covariance of the
				transformed GRV, which may<lb/> lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes
				divergence<lb/> of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a<lb/>
				deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is<lb/> again approximated
				by a GRV, but is now represented using<lb/> a minimal set of carefully chosen sample
				points. These sam-<lb/> ple points completely capture the true mean and
				covariance<lb/> of the GRV, and when propagated through the true non-<lb/>
				linear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance<lb/> 
				accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any<lb/> 
				nonlinearity. The EKF, in contrast, only achieves first-order<lb/> 
				accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the<lb/> 
				UKF is the same order as that of the EKE<lb/> 
				Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial perfor-<lb/> 
				mance gains of the UKF in the context of "estimation<lb/> 
				for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not<lb/> 
				considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class<lb/> 
				of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear sys-<lb/> 
				tem identification, training of neural networks, and dual es-<lb/> 
				timation problems. Our preliminary results were presented<lb/> 
				in [13]. In this paper, the algorithms are further develo<lb/>
