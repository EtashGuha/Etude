		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>Most of the recent color recognition/indexing approaches concentrate on establishing invariance to illumination color to improve the utility of color recognition. However, other effects caused by illumination pose and specularity on three-dimensional <lb/>object surfaces have not received notable attention. We present a chromaticity recognition method that discounts the effects of illumination pose, illumination color and <lb/>specularity. It utilizes a chromaticity space based on log-ratio of sensor responses for <lb/>illumination pose and color invariance. A model-based specularity detection/rejection <lb/>algorithm can be used to improve the chromaticity recognition and illumination estimation for objects including specular reflections. <lb/></div>
