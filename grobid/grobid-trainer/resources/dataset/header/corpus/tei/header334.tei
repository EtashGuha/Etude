		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>A recognition strategy consisting of a mixture of indexing on invariants and search, allows objects to be recog-nised up to a Euclidean ambiguity with an uncalibrated <lb/>camera. The approach works by using projective invariants to determine all the possible projectively equivalent <lb/>models for a particular imaged object; then a system of <lb/>global consistency constraints is used to determine which of <lb/>these projectively equivalent, but Euclidean distinct, models corresponds to the objects viewed. These constraints <lb/>follow from properties of the imaging geometry. In particular, a recognition hypothesis is equivalent to an assertion about, among other things, viewing conditions and geometric relationships between objects, and these assertions <lb/>must be consistent for hypotheses to be correct. The approach is demonstrated to work on images of real scenes <lb/>consisting of polygonal objects and polyhedra.</div>
