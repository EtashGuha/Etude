<div type="introduction">Based on our basic studies of HIV assembly and morphogenesis (chapter 4), we were able to construct<lb/> recombinant, HIV-1 Gag derived VLPs, which allow the presentation of either smaller peptides (40-60<lb/> amino acids) or oligomeric HIV-derived Env glycoproteins. Recombinant VLPs were shown to induce<lb/> sustained Th1-type cellular immune responses as well as neutralizing Env-specific antibody responses<lb/> both in small animal models as well as in non-human primates. Recent ex vivo analysis suggests that<lb/> recombinant VLP purified from insect cells following infection with recombinant Baculovirus induce<lb/> maturation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (upregulation of CD80, CD83, CD86, CD40,<lb/> HLA-DR; secretion of IL6, IL12). Taken together, these results recommended recombinant VLPs as<lb/> basic compound both for T cell-as well as B-cell vaccines.<lb/> Furthermore, exploiting our improved understanding on the HIV codon bias for late lentiviral gene<lb/> expression, technologies have been developed enabeling the design and synthesis of HIV genes that<lb/> allowed transgene expression in complete absence of the viral Rev/RRE system and additional<lb/> cis-acting sequence elements. This strategy has been employed to establish synthetic GagPolNef and<lb/> Env polygene constructs both of which are based on the 97CN54 virus isolate representing the clade C<lb/> epidemic in China (chapter 2). These basic constructs have been selected to construct (i) a DNA<lb/> vaccine (DNA-C; own work), a New-York Vaccinia strain (NYVAC-C; Aventis-Sanofi) and a Modified<lb/> Vaccinia Ankara strain based vaccine (MVA-C, Prof. Esteban). These vaccines turned out to be safe<lb/> and immunogenic in mice models, nonhuman primates and two phase 1 clinical trials (chapter 7).<lb/> To broaden our spectrum of viral vectors for future<lb/> prime boost regimens we have in collaboration with<lb/> Dr. Osterrieder (Cornell University) established<lb/> equine herpesviruses (EHV-1) as vector to deliver<lb/> HIV immunogens via the mucosal route. EHV-1<lb/> efficiently infects human cells including DC at<lb/> minimal MOIs, does hardly replicate in human cells,<lb/> expresses transgenes at high levels and an<lb/> extended period of time and is not neutralized by<lb/> high titered anti-HSV1, -HSV2, -EBV, -Varicella and -<lb/>CMV antisera. BALB/c mice developed upon<lb/> intranasal immunization with Gag recombinant EHV<lb/> high titers of Gag specific antibodies including sIgA<lb/> as well as gag specific T cell reponses that were<lb/> even more pronounced, when DNA-C was used for<lb/> priming immunization.</div>
