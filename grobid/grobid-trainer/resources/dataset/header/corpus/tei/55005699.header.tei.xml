	<div type="introduction">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a prevalent class of small single-stranded non-<lb/>coding RNAs (19-30 nts long). They serve widespread functions as regulatory mol-<lb/>ecules in post-transcriptional gene silencing and have recently emerged as crucial<lb/> regulators of gene expression, development, proliferation and differentiation, and<lb/> apoptosis.<lb/> Since the discovery of miRNAs in 1993, the number of miRNAs in the Sanger<lb/> miRBASE database has rapidly increased. Precursor miRNAs (based on miRBASE)<lb/> have been found to date in virtually all speciesâ€”animals, plants, and viruses. As<lb/> many as one-third of all mammalian genes may be miRNA-regulated. This diverse<lb/> yet fundamentally conserved group of small RNAs may rival classical transcription<lb/> factors in their role and involvement in modulating the complex regulatory circuitry<lb/> found in cells.<lb/></div>
