		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The V -cycle of the wavelet variation of the &quot;Frequency decomposition multigrid method&quot; of Hackbusch [Numer. Math., 56, pp. <lb/>229-245, 1989] is considered. <lb/>It is shown that its convergence speed is not affected by the presence of anisotropy provided that the corresponding coarse grid correction is damped sufficiently strong. Our analysis is based on properties <lb/>of wavelet packets which are supplied and proved. <lb/>Numerical approximations to the speed of convergence illustrate <lb/>the theoretical results. <lb/></div>
