		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper describes a general-purpose programming technique, called the Simulation of <lb/>Simplicity, which can be used to cope with degenerate input data for geometric algorithms. <lb/>It relieves the programmer from the task to provide a consistent treatment for every single <lb/>special case that can occur. The programs that use the technique tend to be considerably <lb/>smaller and more robust than those that do not use it. We believe that this technique will <lb/>become a standard tool in writing geometric software. <lb/></div>
