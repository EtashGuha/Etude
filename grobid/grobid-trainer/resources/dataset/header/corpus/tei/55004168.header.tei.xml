	<div type="abstract">Abstract Studying biofilm formation and influence of the matrix composition was heavy<lb/> because only old and long methods were employed up to now: confocal microscopy,<lb/> fluorescent chemical markers, and/or dying techniques. In this context, an innovative tool,<lb/> the BioFilm Ring TestÂ®, was here employed to explore the role of exopolysaccharides,<lb/> proteins, and nucleic acids in the formation of biofilm by Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The<lb/> principle is to add magnetic particles in the culture medium. When a biofilm is formed,<lb/> particles are unable to migrate in the media to form a ring when a magnet is brought nearer<lb/> to the well. Therefore, culture media supplemented with proteases, glycanases, and/or<lb/> nucleases allowed us to identify the involvement of these substances in L. mesenteroides<lb/> biofilm formation. The results permitted to demonstrate that dextran, proteins, and nucleic<lb/> acids are implied in biofilm formation.<lb/></div>
