	Gruening find considerable benefits from shampoo and conditioner using<lb/> silicone quaternium-22<lb/> The presence of broken fibres can be a major detractor in the quest for beautiful hair.<lb/> For some, just seeing broken hair fragments in a brush or comb can be a source of<lb/> worry. This is largely because broken fibres fray and lead to the formation of unsightly<lb/> split ends, but also fibres no longer align as readily, often reducing the perception of<lb/> hair smoothness, inducing a degree of frizz, lowering shine and hindering a fluid flowing<lb/> motion. Consumers therefore worry about breakage and look to product manufacturers<lb/> for help.<lb/> Attempts at resolving this issue begin with a better<lb/> understanding of the problem and the factors that<lb/> lead to breakage. Two previous publications<lb/> [1,2] have<lb/> focused on modeling hair fibre breakage under<lb/> fatiguing conditions. Conventional tensile testing of<lb/> hair generally involves applying a one-time external<lb/> force or deformation that is sufficient to induce<lb/> breakage. However, fatiguing involves the repeated<lb/> application of relatively small stimuli which may be<lb/> considered more analogous to the rigours associated<lb/> with everyday grooming. Fundamental single fibre<lb/> fatigue studies<lb/> [1] showed an exponential relationship<lb/> between the magnitude of the applied repeating<lb/> stress and the tendency for hair breakage. It<lb/> therefore becomes apparent how a lubricating<lb/> conditioner treatment that lowers the stresses<lb/> associated with grooming will consequently produce a reduced tendency for hair<lb/> breakage.</div>
