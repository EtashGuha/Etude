	<div type="abstract">Abstract Over the past few years, several &quot;premium&quot; sand control<lb/> screens have been introduced into the market. The<lb/> proliferation of new screens has raised questions about how to<lb/> choose the proper sand control screen for a particular<lb/> formation. In order to address this concern, a project was<lb/> initiated at Chevron to devise a method to evaluate sand<lb/> control screens.<lb/> As a result of this program, a method has been<lb/> standardized for the evaluation of sand control screens. The<lb/> method known as the Screen Efficiency Test shows the<lb/> relationship between the normalized sand control<lb/> characteristics (i.e., Sand Control Factor) of the screens and<lb/> the normalized length of time it takes a screen to plug under a<lb/> certain set of conditions (i.e., the Performance Factor). The<lb/> results of Screen Efficiency tests to evaluate several sand<lb/> control screens for a North Sea and West Africa field are<lb/> discussed in the paper.<lb/> The data in this paper also documents that the numerical<lb/> rating given the screens by the manufacturers are generally not<lb/> very useful in understanding the sand control rating of the<lb/> particular screen, or comparing screens from different<lb/> manufacturers.<lb/> In addition, the effect of particle size<lb/> distribution and sand concentration on the relative<lb/> performance of sand control screens was demonstrated.<lb/></div>
