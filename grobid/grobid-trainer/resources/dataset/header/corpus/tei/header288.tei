		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>This paper describes automatic document categorization based on large text hierarchy. We <lb/>handle the large number of features and training examples by taking into account hierarchical <lb/>structure of examples and using feature selection for large text data. We experimentally evaluate <lb/>feature subset selection on real-world text data collected from the existing Web hierarchy named <lb/>Yahoo. In our learning experiments naive Bayesian classifier was used on text data using feature-vector document representation that includes word sequences (n-grams) instead of just single words <lb/>(unigrams). Experimental evaluation on real-world data collected form the Web shows that our <lb/>approach gives promising results and can potentially be used for document categorization on the <lb/>Web. Additionally the best result on our data is achieved for relatively small feature subset, while for <lb/>larger subset the performance substantially drops. The best performance among six tested feature <lb/>scoring measure was achieved by the feature scoring measure called Odds ratio that is known from <lb/>information retrieval. <lb/></div>
