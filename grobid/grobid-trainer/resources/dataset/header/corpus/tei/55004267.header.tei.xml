	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> A new method is developed to chemically functionalize multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) based on silanization reaction for<lb/> use as the reinforcement for polymer matrix composites. To oxidize and create active moieties on the MWCNTs, the samples were<lb/> exposed to UV light within the ozone chamber, followed by silanization using 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxy silane after the oxidized<lb/> MWCNTs were reduced by lithium aluminum hydride. FT-IR, TEM and XPS were employed to characterize the changes in carbon<lb/> nanotubes surface morphology, chemistry and physical conditions at different processing stages. The results indicate improved dispersion<lb/> and attachment of silane molecules on the surface of the MWCNTs.<lb/></div>
