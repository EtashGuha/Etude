			<div type="abstract">Abstract A kinetic model describing the impact of singlet delta
				oxygen O 2 (a 1 &#x6ef59; g ) produced in a gas<lb/> discharge plasma on the
				evolution of hydrogen–oxygen mixture composition is developed. In<lb/> the framework
				of this model the possibility of describing all the main experimental data on
				the<lb/> dynamics of O 2 (a 1 &#x6ef59; g ) quenching in H 2 : O 2 gas mixtures in
				the temperature range<lb/> T 0 = 300–1050 K is shown. Most of the collisions between
				singlet oxygen molecules and<lb/> atomic hydrogen, O 2 (a 1 &#x6ef59; g ) + H, lead
				to quenching of O 2 (a 1 &#x6ef59; g ). The efficiency of this<lb/> interaction
				channel is more than 80% and the fraction of the reaction<lb/> H + O 2 (a 1
				&#x6ef59; g ) → OH + O( 3 P) is only 10–20%. The impact of singlet oxygen O 2 (a 1
				&#x6ef59; g )<lb/> admixture on the ignition of H 2 : O 2 mixtures is investigated.
				The dominant process<lb/> determining the degree of O 2 (a 1 &#x6ef59; g ) impact is
				its deactivation by HO 2 molecules. As a result,<lb/> in H 2 : O 2 mixtures of high
				pressure, where the number density of the produced HO 2<lb/> molecules can be
				sufficiently high, the impact of singlet oxygen on the ignition delay time of<lb/>
				these mixtures turns out to be relatively weak. This effect becomes even less
				noticeable if<lb/> admixtures of atomic oxygen are present in the mixture. Oxygen
				atoms produced by the<lb/> discharge are more efficient in the ignition of
				hydrogen–oxygen and hydrogen–air mixtures<lb/> than O 2 (a 1 &#x6ef59; g )
				molecules. Thus, to reduce the ignition delay time and to decrease the<lb/>
				temperature threshold of combustive mixtures, the use of gas discharge systems
				providing the<lb/> efficient production of atomic particles is
				recommended.<lb/></div>
