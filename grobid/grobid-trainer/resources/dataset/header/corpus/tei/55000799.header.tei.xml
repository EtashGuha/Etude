	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> This paper reports a novel room temperature hermetic<lb/> liquid sealing process based on wire bonded &quot;plugs&quot; over the<lb/> access ports of liquid-filled cavities. The method enables liq-<lb/>uids to be integrated already at the fabrication stage. Test<lb/> vehicles were manufactured and used to investigate the me-<lb/>chanical and hermetic properties of the seals. A helium leak<lb/> rate of better than 10 −10 mbarL/s was measured on the suc-<lb/>cessfully sealed structures. The bond strength of the &quot;plugs&quot;<lb/> were similar to standard wire bonds on flat surfaces.<lb/></div>
