	<div type="abstract">Name of the Drug<lb/> Doxorubicin<lb/> Composition<lb/> Active. Doxorubicin hydrochloride.<lb/> Inactive. Sodium chloride, dilute hydrochloric acid and water for injections.<lb/> Description<lb/> Doxorubicin hydrochloride: Molecular formula, C 27 H 29 NO 11 .HCl.; MW, 580.0 and CAS number ,<lb/> 25316-40-9. It is soluble in water and slightly soluble in methanol.<lb/> Doxorubicin hydrochloride solution for injection is red in colour.<lb/> Doxorubicin hydrochloride is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of<lb/> Streptomyces peucetius varians caesius. The chemical structure of doxorubicin consists of a tetracyclic<lb/> ring with the sugar daunosamine attached by a glycosidic linkage. Structurally, doxorubicin is related<lb/> to daunomycin (daunorubicin) and differs only in hydroxyl group substitution (instead of hydrogen) at<lb/> the alkyl side chain at position &apos;9&apos; of the &apos;A&apos; ring. It is supplied in solution form containing sodium<lb/> chloride.<lb/> Pharmacology<lb/> Though not completely elucidated, the mechanism of action of doxorubicin is related to its ability to<lb/> bind to DNA and inhibit nucleic acid synthesis. Cell culture studies have demonstrated rapid cell<lb/> penetration and perinucleolar chromatin binding, rapid inhibition of mitotic activity and nucleic acid<lb/> synthesis, mutagenesis and chromosomal aberrations.<lb/> Doxorubicin has immunosuppressive effects. It inhibits the titre of haemolytic and haemagglutinating<lb/> antibodies in mice immunised with sheep red blood cells. Similar evidence in humans indicates that<lb/> doxorubicin is a powerful but temporary immunosuppressant agent. Doxorubicin is a cell cycle, phase<lb/> nonspecific cytotoxic drug.<lb/></div>

	<div type="introduction">The toxic effects of doxorubicin on the bone marrow appear to be related to its action on proliferating<lb/> myeloid cells. The cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin is probably mediated by different mechanisms.<lb/> Although in animal systems, doxorubicin does inhibit DNA synthesis in cardiac muscle, it is probable<lb/> that cardiotoxicity is not directly related to inhibition of cardiac muscle replication. There are some<lb/> data that suggest that it is due to the generation of free radicals which damage cardiac muscle in some<lb/> uncertain way. These data also suggest that concurrent administration of vitamin E and other free<lb/> radical acceptors may prevent cardiotoxicity in experimental animal systems without impairing<lb/> antitumour efficacy. These studies need confirmation but they do suggest that it may be possible to<lb/> divorce the antitumour effects of the drug from its cumulative cardiotoxic effects.<lb/> The specificity of doxorubicin toxicity appears to be related primarily to proliferative activity of normal<lb/> tissue. Thus the bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract and gonads are the main normal tissues damaged.</div>
