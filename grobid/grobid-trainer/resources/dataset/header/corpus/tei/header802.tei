		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>In the verification of cryptographic protocols along the <lb/>approach of the logic for authentication by Burrows, <lb/>Abadi, and Needham, it is possible to write a specification which does not faithfully represent the real world <lb/>situation. Such a specification, though impossible or <lb/>unreasonable to implement, can go undetected and be <lb/>verified to be correct. It can also lead to logical statements that do not preserve causality, which in turn can <lb/>have undesirable consequences. Such a specification, <lb/>called an infeasible specification here, can be subtle and <lb/>hard to locate. This note shows how the logic of cryptographic protocols by Gong, Needham, and Yahalom <lb/>can be enhanced with a notion of eligibility to preserve <lb/>causality of beliefs and detect infeasible specifications. <lb/>It is conceivable that this technique can be adopted in <lb/>other similar logics. <lb/></div>
