	</docTitle>

	<div type="abstract">Intellectual property regimes are vital determinants of the pace of innovation<lb/> and thus of growth and competitiveness in a knowledge economy. How does<lb/> the European patent system measure up? Bruno van Pottelsberghe first looks<lb/> at the performance of patent arrangements in Europe, especially their cost-<lb/>effectiveness and the consistency of rules and remedies across countries. He<lb/> then looks at current attempts at global patent cooperation to see if they will<lb/> help or hinder the emergence of innovation worldwide and in Europe.<lb/> Using new and hard-hitting data, van Pottelsberghe paints a dark picture of<lb/> today&apos;s patent landscape both in Europe and internationally. It is a tale of<lb/> failed public cooperation at all levels and of a regime in danger of rampant<lb/> patent inflation unless minds and resources are focused on tackling the root<lb/> causes of the problem. This book comes forward with a sequence of concrete,<lb/> short-, medium-and long-term policy recommendations to this end.<lb/> Bruegel is a European think tank devoted to international economics. It is<lb/> supported by European governments and international corporations.<lb/> Bruegel&apos;s aim is to contribute to the quality of economic policymaking in<lb/> Europe through open, fact-based and policy-relevant research, analysis and<lb/> discussion.</div>
