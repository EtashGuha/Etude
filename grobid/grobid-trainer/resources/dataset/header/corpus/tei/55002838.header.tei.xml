	<div type="introduction">New soluble and intrinsic amorphous red emitters 1 and 2<lb/> were obtained by Suzuki coupling. Due to the close molec-<lb/>ular polarities, separation of target products from monocou-<lb/>pling impurities presents a challenge. The results showed<lb/> highly pure 2 would be a potentially valuable fluorophore<lb/> for solution-processed pure red electroluminescence in terms<lb/> of visual sensitivity with respect to 1.<lb/> Organic light-emitting materials and devices are continuing<lb/> to advance toward practical applications since the early invention<lb/> of efficient light-emitting diodes based on sublimable low<lb/> molecular mass materials 1 and subsequent important observation<lb/> of polymer electroluminescence (EL). 2 For the purposes of low<lb/> cost device processing and large area display, solution-based<lb/> technologies such as spin coating and printing techniques present<lb/> distinct advantages. Along with this development, there is an<lb/> ongoing interest in the synthesis of solution processible organic<lb/> emitters. 3,4 Among others, starburst and dendritic molecules have<lb/> received particular attention since the well-defined multi-<lb/>branched structures could not only effectively suppress inter-<lb/>molecular interactions and improve solid luminous efficiencies<lb/> but also tend to induce a glassy state which is one of the crucial<lb/> factors affecting the device durability. Highly efficient device<lb/> performances have been observed based on such solution-<lb/>processed fluorescent and phosphorescent emitters in the bulk<lb/> and blend. 4,5 With the latter, a small molecular charge-<lb/>transporting host, 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP),<lb/> is usually used. 4,5b<lb/> In the current scenario of materials development for solution<lb/> processing, convenient and efficient syntheses of high-<lb/>performance organic emitters with pure RGB emission are still<lb/> desired for color display. For a material to possess solution<lb/> processibility, a proper solubility and intrinsic glassy state are<lb/> favored whether it be a host or dopant emitter. In the vacuum-<lb/>deposited light-emitting devices (LEDs), the emitting materials<lb/> are not necessary to be inherently amorphous, and those capable<lb/> of forming molecular glasses under cooling from an isotropic<lb/> melt are equally important. In this sense, the molecular design<lb/> of solution processible emitters seems more demanding. Mean-<lb/>while, the synthesis might be troubled by purification. For<lb/> instance, the potentially close molecular polarities between target<lb/> products and reactants/reaction intermediates would likely render<lb/> purification problematic by column separation, especially in<lb/> synthesizing uniform multibranched molecules. 6 In addition, for<lb/> solution-processed molecular emitters, the tradeoff between<lb/> morphological stabilities and solubilities has to be taken into<lb/> consideration when solubilizing alkyl groups are introduced.<lb/> Nevertheless, despite the challenges that might be encoun-<lb/>tered, such as multistep reactions, purification, and yield<lb/> concerns, it is worthwhile to explore new solution processible<lb/> organic electroluminophores and synthetic possibilities to push<lb/> them toward practical applications in virtue of the unique<lb/> advantages they offer, such as potentially high materials purity<lb/> and availability of reliable property-structure correlation with<lb/> respect to polymers. We have become interested recently in<lb/> solution-processed molecular materials 7 and describe herein a<lb/> new series of soluble and intrinsic amorphous red emitters 1<lb/> and 2, based on double end-capped 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-<lb/>benzothiadiazole and 4,7-di(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-ben-<lb/>zothiadiazole, respectively (Scheme 1). 8,9 Due to electronic and<lb/> structural reasons, pure red-emitting molecules and polymers<lb/> are often susceptible to significant fluorescence quenching in<lb/> the neat films. Interestingly, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole was found<lb/> to be an important and convenient class of electron acceptors<lb/> and used to construct highly red photoemissive polymer solids<lb/> for potential LED applications 9 since the observation of high</div>
