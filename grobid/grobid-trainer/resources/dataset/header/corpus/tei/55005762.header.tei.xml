	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The particle size distribution of component materials can be<lb/> important parameter governing the proper function of many<lb/> industrial products. At present, accurate determination of<lb/> particle size by currently available methods is difficult for<lb/> both theoretical and practical reasons. In this paper, some<lb/> elementary notions regarding particle sizing are reviewed as is<lb/> the relative performance of commercially available particle<lb/> sizing instrumentation which could be used for particle size<lb/> analysis of dry powders. Our results indicate that various par-<lb/>ticle size instruments yield significantly (even vastly) different<lb/> particle size distributions for the same material. Without<lb/> great care on the part of the investigator, the results obtained<lb/> from any given instrument may not accurately describe the<lb/> powder in question and thus may cause incorrect technical<lb/> recommendations. The use of Fraunhofer diffraction in-<lb/>struments on samples containing irregularly shaped small<lb/> ( &lt; l o pm) particles of low refractive index requires con-<lb/>siderable caution.<lb/></div>
