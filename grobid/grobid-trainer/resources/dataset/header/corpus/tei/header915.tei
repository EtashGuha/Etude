		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>A scheme to compute smoothing spline ANOVA estimates for large data sets with a (near) <lb/>tensor-product structure is proposed. Such data sets are common in spatial-temporal analysis and <lb/>image analysis. This scheme combines backfitting algorithm with iterative imputation algorithm in <lb/>order to save both computational space and time. The convergence of this algorithm and various <lb/>ways to further speed it up, such as collapsing component functions and successive over-relaxation, <lb/>are discussed. Issues related to its application in spatial-temporal analysis are discussed too. An <lb/>application to a global analysis of historical surface temperature data is described. <lb/></div>
