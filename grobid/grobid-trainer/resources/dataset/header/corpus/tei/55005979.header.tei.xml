	<div type="abstract">SUMMARY<lb/> The additive &quot;Kemzyme W dry&quot; consists of a mixture of five enzymes including an Î±-<lb/>amylase produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9553) and bacillolysin produced by<lb/> Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9554). The European Food Safety Authority received a<lb/> request to assess the safety of the additive with particular regard to the ability of the<lb/> Bacillus production strains to produce toxins. Information provided by the company showed<lb/> that the results for the toxicity assays were negative, and no immunological cross reactivity<lb/> with B. cereus enterotoxins was observed. Therefore, the Panel on Additives and Products<lb/> or Substances used in Animal Feed is satisfied that the production strains DSM 9553 and<lb/> DSM 9554 when used as a source of extracellular enzyme do not present a toxigenic risk.<lb/></div>
