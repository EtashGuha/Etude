	<div type="abstract">ABSTRACT<lb/> Confocal microscopy is the method of choice in biological 3D-imaging, however, the axial resolution is limited to<lb/> ~500 nm. During the last decade it has been successfully demonstrated that the axial resolution can be substantially<lb/> improved with 4Pi microscopy. We report a 4Pi microscope realized as a fast beam scanning system consisting of a 4Pi-<lb/>module linked to a state-of-the-art confocal microscope. As a result, the advantages of the confocal system such as<lb/> scanning, sensitive multicolor detection and imaging speed are combined with the superior resolution of 4Pi microscopy.<lb/> This novel microscope is eminently suited for biological applications. It is designed both for single-photon and for two-<lb/>photon picosecond excitation, and also enables joint coherent illumination and detection, i.e. 4Pi type C. The superior<lb/> PSF and OTF of the system enable 80 nm axial resolution in cells mounted in aqueous media. We present the optical<lb/> design of the system and demonstrate an up to 7-fold improved optical sectioning in live cells.<lb/></div>
