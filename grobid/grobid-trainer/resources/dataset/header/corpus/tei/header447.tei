		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We describe the design principles and functionality <lb/>of a visual query language called SeeQL that represents data retrieval and analysis operations as a data-flow graph. A query is viewed as a sequence of relational algebra and other data transformation operations applied to database tables. The language is well-suited for large-scale scientific database applications, <lb/>where data analysis is a major component and the typical queries or data retrieval patterns are unrestricted. <lb/>The language provides a flexible yet easy-to-use environment for database access and data analysis for <lb/>non-programmer research scientists. We have implemented this language in a system being used in a long-term data-intensive highway pavement research project <lb/>(MnRoad) conducted by the Minnesota Department of <lb/>Transportation. <lb/></div>
