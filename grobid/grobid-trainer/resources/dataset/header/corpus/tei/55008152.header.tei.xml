	<div type="abstract">Abstract<lb/> The need for scalable key management<lb/> support for Mobile IP – especially, the route-optimized Mobile<lb/> IP – is well known. In this paper, we present the design and the<lb/> first implementation of a public key management system that can<lb/> be used with IETF Mobile IP. The system, called the Mobile IP<lb/> Security (MoIPS) system, was built upon a DNS based X.509<lb/> Public Key Infrastructure with innovation in certificate and CRL<lb/> dispatch as well as light-weight key generation. The system can<lb/> be used to supply key parameters for authenticating Mobile IPv.4<lb/> location management messages and to establish IPSec tunnels for<lb/> Mobile IP redirected packets. It can also be used to augment<lb/> emerging firewall traversal techniques for Mobile IP. A FreeBSD<lb/> UNIX prototype with core functionality was completed at the time<lb/> this paper was published.<lb/></div>
