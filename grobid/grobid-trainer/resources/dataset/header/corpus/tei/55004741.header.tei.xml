	<div type="abstract">All four subclasses of IgG antibodies to timothy grass pollen extract were measured by a<lb/> three-layer immunoradiometric assay in sera from 20 grass pollen-allergic patients who<lb/> underwent specific immunotherapy in a 3-year prospective study. Both IgGl and IgG4<lb/> antibody levels rose significantly during the first 8 weeks of immunotherapy, IgGl antibody<lb/> level passed its peak (median 5,4 U/ml) after 12 weeks. At tbis time, the ratio between the<lb/> medians of IgGl and IgG4 autibodies was 2,25, lgCi4 antibody level reacbed its peak<lb/> (median 11,6 U/ml) just before termination of immunotherapy. At this time lgGl/IgG4<lb/> -ratio was 0,43, Two years after the end of immunotherapy, lgCl aud lgG4 antibody levels<lb/> were 0,0 and 1,8 U/ml in median, respectively. The amounts of lgG2 and IgG3 antibodies<lb/> detected in the sera were less than 1,6 U/ml and were considered insignificant, Preseasonal<lb/> serum IgGl and IgG4 antibody levels did not correlate significantly with symptom scores in<lb/> the subsequent season. Serum IgG4 level obtained after 12 weeks of immunotberapy was<lb/> significantly correlated to symptom score in the third season, i,e, the season just after<lb/> -termination of therapy (75 = 0,529, t = 2,567, P = 0,02), In this work, a serum lgG4<lb/> antibody level bigher than 8,0 U/ml after 12 weeks of therapy predicted poor clinical result<lb/> at the end of immunotherapy with 100% sensitivity and 87% specificity. An IgG4/IgGl<lb/> ratio greater than 1,0 after 12 weeks&apos; therapy had the same predictive value.<lb/></div>
