		<div type="abstract">Abstract. Evolving algebras (EAs) as defined by Yuri Gurevich constitute the basis of a powerful and elegant specification and verification <lb/>method which has successfully been applied to the design and analysis of <lb/>various kinds of discrete dynamic systems. Aiming at the development <lb/>of a comprehensive EA-based specification and design environment, we <lb/>introduce the concept of an evolving algebra abstract machine (EAM ) as <lb/>a platform for the systematic development of EA tools; for instance, as <lb/>required for machine based analysis and execution of EA specifications. <lb/>We give a formal definition of the EAM ground model in terms of a <lb/>universal evolving algebra, where we validate the correctness of the relation between evolving algebras (their theoretical foundations) and their <lb/>EAM representation and interpretation. Our approach covers sequential <lb/>as well as distributed evolving algebras. <lb/></div>
