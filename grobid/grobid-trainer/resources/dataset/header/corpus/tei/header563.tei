		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We have studied the performance of a high-speed <lb/>commercial spread-spectrum wireless LAN that uses the <lb/>CSMA/CA multiple-access strategy. Employing synthetic workloads, we measured packet capture success <lb/>more so than signal propagation characteristics. Specifically, we measured throughput, packet loss rates, range, <lb/>and patterns of errors within packets. We conclude <lb/>that CSMA/CA is quite successful in allocating bandwidth under stress, but that packet capture rate degrades very quickly once the LAN&apos;s effective range is <lb/>exceeded. Hence, network maintainers should plan the <lb/>layout of wireless networks at least as carefully as they <lb/>plan wired networks. <lb/></div>
