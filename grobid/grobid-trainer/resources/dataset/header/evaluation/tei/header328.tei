		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>We are developing design principles applying tangible interfaces to storytelling. This paper describes an underlying <lb/>philosophy and three resultant designs for computer-mediated toys, exploring how the merging of physical objects <lb/>with computer technology can enhance childrens storytelling. Each prototype aims to develop a specific set of both <lb/>oral and written storytelling skills, as well as collaboration, sharing, and the notion of revision. By creating <lb/>narratives, children learn about culture and identity, and develop a sense of self. In addition, narrative can be used as <lb/>a gateway to draw girls into technology. The use of multi-sensory interfaces allows for richer interaction. <lb/></div>
