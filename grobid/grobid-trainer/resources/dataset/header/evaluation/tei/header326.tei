		<div type="abstract">Abstract <lb/>The use of graphs to represent independence structure in multivariate probability <lb/>models has been pursued in a relatively independent fashion across a wide variety of <lb/>research disciplines since the beginning of this century. This paper provides a brief <lb/>overview of the current status of such research with particular attention to recent developments which have served to unify such seemingly disparate topics as probabilistic <lb/>expert systems, statistical physics, image analysis, genetics, decoding of error-correcting <lb/>codes, Kalman filters, and speech recognition with Markov models. <lb/></div>
