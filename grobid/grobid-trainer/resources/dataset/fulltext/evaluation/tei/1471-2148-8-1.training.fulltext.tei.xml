			<p>The biological species concept defines a species as an<lb/> interbreeding group that is reproductively isolated from<lb/> other such groups <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. Species are isolated by barriers that<lb/> either prevent fertilisation between species (prezygotic<lb/> barriers) or those that allow fertilisation but make the<lb/> resulting hybrid sterile or inviable (postzygotic barriers)<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref> (for a review see <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Mating in yeast occurs through the fusion of haploid gam-<lb/>etes. When starved, diploid Saccharomyces yeast cells pro-<lb/>duce haploid spores by meiosis. Each diploid cell<lb/> produces four dormant and resilient haploid spores, two<lb/> spores of each mating type (a and α). When nutrients<lb/> become available again the spores germinate to become<lb/> metabolically active gametes. Gametes of both mating<lb/> types produce attractive pheromones used to signal to the<lb/> other mating type. Gametes of different mating-types fuse,<lb/> producing diploid zygotes that can reproduce asexually by<lb/> mitosis until nutrients are exhausted again <ref type="biblio">[4,5]</ref>.<lb/> </p>
			
			<p>Saccharomyces sensu stricto species are postzygotically iso-<lb/>lated. Diploid F1 hybrids are formed by fusion of gametes<lb/> from different species. These hybrids can reproduce asex-<lb/>ually by mitosis, but spores produced by meiosis are invi-<lb/>able, failing to germinate and form gametes <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. Thus F1<lb/> hybrids are viable but sexually sterile. Several recent inves-<lb/>tigations have examined possible causes of this hybrid ste-<lb/>rility, and concluded that sequence and chromosomal<lb/> differences between the species are major contributors <ref type="biblio">[7-<lb/>9]</ref>. Two Saccharomyces species, S. cerevisiae and S. para-<lb/>doxus, have been found to occupy the same natural habitat<lb/> (oak trees and associated soils) <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>, providing the oppor-<lb/>tunity for hybridisation. Kuehne et al <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref> have recently<lb/> shown that the North American and Eurasian S. paradoxus<lb/> isolates represent two distinct groups. Within each group<lb/> the strains are highly related (indicating a large breeding<lb/> population) and have distributions spanning their respec-<lb/>tive land masses <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>. The population structure of S. cere-<lb/>visiae is not so clear, perhaps because human<lb/> domestication of the species overshadows their natural<lb/> biogeography <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>. Yeast hybrids can be formed in the<lb/> laboratory but wild F1 hybrids, containing a full genome<lb/> from both S. paradoxus and S. cerevisiae, have not been<lb/> described <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>. Several reports have, however, shown<lb/> introgression of genes between the two species, indicating<lb/> that interspecific mating can occur in the wild <ref type="biblio">[12-14]</ref>.<lb/> Given that hybrids are sexually sterile, the ability to avoid<lb/> hybridisation may be favoured by natural selection.<lb/></p>

			<p>In a recent paper Murphy et al. <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> failed to find prezy-<lb/>gotic reproductive isolation between species from sympat-<lb/>ric natural populations of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus.<lb/> Murphy et al. <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> assayed species recognition using indi-<lb/>vidual mate choice trials: a single vegetative haploid cell<lb/> of known mating type was placed in contact with a con-<lb/>specific and a heterospecific vegetative cell of the opposite<lb/> mating type. The results showed that S. cerevisiae cells<lb/> mated with other S. cerevisiae cells more often than they<lb/> mated with S. paradoxus cells, as expected if a prezygotic<lb/> barrier existed. But, surprisingly, Murphy et al. <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> found<lb/> that S. paradoxus cells mated with S. cerevisiae cells (form-<lb/>ing sterile hybrids) more often than they mated with other<lb/> S. paradoxus cells. They explained this result by the obser-<lb/>vation that the mating propensity (the tendency or readi-<lb/>ness to mate) of S. cerevisiae gametes was higher than that<lb/> of S. paradoxus gametes and therefore focal cells of either<lb/> species were more likely to be able to mate with the more<lb/> willing S. cerevisiae gametes, regardless of whether or not<lb/> a hybrid zygote was produced. This difference in mating<lb/> propensity confounded the quantification of prezygotic<lb/> isolation between the species, and Murphy et al. <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> were<lb/> unable to detect prezygotic reproductive isolation. How-<lb/>ever they proposed that differences in mating kinetics<lb/> could potentially provide a prezygotic isolation barrier,<lb/> because fast maters would tend to mate with fast maters,<lb/> and slow maters with slow maters. Such a barrier can<lb/> evolve readily in the laboratory under artificial selection<lb/> against mating between genetically marked strains of the<lb/> same species <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although very little is known about yeast life history in<lb/> nature, it is likely that most mating occurs immediately<lb/> after germination, usually between members of the same<lb/> tetrad, and without any haploid cell division <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>.<lb/> Because wild yeast are naturally homothallic (see for<lb/> example <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref> and <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>), and unfertilized gametes can<lb/> switch mating type after dividing to enable them to fuse<lb/> with their daughter cells, even isolated single spores<lb/> should yield diploid, not haploid cultures <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. Murphy et<lb/> al. <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> prevented their strains from switching mating type<lb/> in culture by knocking out their HO genes with drug-<lb/>resistance markers, allowing the culture of clones of vege-<lb/>tative haploid gametes. However such clones of unferti-<lb/>lised gametes are not thought to occur in natural strains<lb/> with intact HO genes. Unfertilised gametes exist only<lb/> rarely and transiently, after spore germination but before<lb/> fertilisation by either a neighbouring germinated spore or<lb/> mating-type switched clone-mate. Thus the potential for<lb/> hybridization in nature is highest when spores from dif-<lb/>ferent species happen to be in contact at the time of ger-<lb/>mination. Such close contact between spores from<lb/> different species might occur if they occupy the same hab-<lb/>itat (e.g. the surface of oak trees), or if they are brought<lb/> together in the digestive tracts of species that eat yeast<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. Yeast-feeding insects, such as Drosophila, completely<lb/> digest vegetative yeast cells, but yeast spores are not<lb/> digested and are passed through the gut unharmed and<lb/> ready to germinate <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>. Therefore prezygotic reproduc-<lb/>tive isolation is likely to involve species differences in ger-<lb/>mination conditions or timing as well as in gamete fusion.<lb/></p>

			<p>Here we present the results of mate choice assays using<lb/> wild type homothallic (HO) single spores of five S. cerevi-<lb/>siae and five S. paradoxus isolates from natural popula-<lb/>tions. All pairings were made between strains isolated<lb/> from the same continent (either North America or Eura-<lb/>sia). Strains used in three of the pairings were both iso-<lb/>lated from the same small woodland area and can be<lb/> considered sympatric <ref type="biblio">[18,11]</ref> (see Methods for full strain<lb/> details).<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Both species avoid hybridisation<lb/></head>

			<p>Individual mate choice assays were conducted by placing<lb/> two spores of one species (the chooser strain) in contact<lb/> with a single spore from the other species. All spores were<lb/> taken from different tetrads to ensure mating types were<lb/> sampled randomly. Since it is impossible to determine the<lb/> mating types of spores before germination, deviations<lb/> from random mating were calculated based on probabil-<lb/>ity (see Methods and <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Hybrid and non-hybrid<lb/> zygotes were identified using species specific PCR. Mate<lb/> choice trials were carried out using five independent pairs<lb/> of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus strains (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).<lb/></p> 
			
			<p><ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the proportion of matings that resulted in<lb/> hybrid zygotes for each of the five independent species<lb/> pairs. If mating was random with respect to species, then<lb/> on average 2/3 (66.67%) of the zygotes formed would be<lb/> hybrids (see Methods). Instead, we found that for every<lb/> pair, whether S. cerevisiae or S. paradoxus occupied the role<lb/> of chooser, significantly fewer hybrid zygotes were formed<lb/> than expected by random mating (full data in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> and<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Both species in each pair had similar mating propensities<lb/></head>

			<p>Many trials did not result in a zygote, either because all<lb/> three spores in a trial were the same mating type (this will<lb/> occur on average in 25% of trials – see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) or<lb/> because mating does not always occur even when trials do<lb/> contain gametes of both mating types. Differences in mat-<lb/>ing propensity between the species in each pair would<lb/> mean that a higher proportion of trials would result in<lb/> zygotes when the species with a high mating propensity<lb/> was &quot;chooser&quot; than when the species with a low mating<lb/> propensity was chooser. For each pair, we found no signif-<lb/>icant difference between the number of zygotes formed<lb/> when either strain was chooser (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">S. cerevisiae is choosier than S. paradoxus<lb/></head>

			<p>Do spores always choose to mate with a member of their<lb/> own species, if available? If hybrids only form when there<lb/> is no mate of the same species available, then on average<lb/> only 1/3 of zygotes formed would be expected to be<lb/> hybrids (<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). We tested whether there was significa-<lb/>tion deviation from this expectation (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Only one<lb/> of the five S. cerevisiae strains (Sc1) produced a signifi-<lb/>cantly higher proportion of hybrid zygotes than the 1/3<lb/> expected if a S. cerevisiae strain always chose to mate with<lb/> a member of its own species. In contrast four of the five S.<lb/> paradoxus strains (Sp1, Sp2, Sp3 and Sp4) produced a sig-<lb/>nificantly higher number of hybrid zygote than the 1/3<lb/> predicted under the &quot;always choose own species&quot; model.<lb/></p>

			<p>W<lb/> e also noted that, in all five pairs, fewer hybrid zygotes<lb/> were formed when S. cerevisiae was chooser than when S.<lb/> paradoxus was chooser. This suggested prezygotic isolation<lb/> was stronger when S. cerevisiae was the chooser than when<lb/> S. paradoxus was chooser.<lb/></p>
			
			<p>We wanted to determine the effect of two factors on the<lb/> strength of prezygotic reproductive isolation: the species<lb/> choosing, and whether the pair of species were isolated in<lb/> allopatry or sympatry (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). To do this we per-<lb/>formed a joint analysis by means of a Generalised Linear<lb/> Model (GLM). To accommodate the binary structure of<lb/> the data (hybrid mating vs. non-hybrid mating) we car-<lb/>ried out a binomial GLM with logit link function. We<lb/> included the factors &apos;species&apos; (S. cerevisiae or S. paradoxus),<lb/> &apos;locality&apos; (sympatric or allopatric) and their interaction.<lb/> The analysis was performed using the statistical package R<lb/> (version 2.4.1, R Development Core Team 2007) <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>.<lb/> The GLM showed that across sympatric and allopatric<lb/> matings, species differ significantly in the level of pre-<lb/>zygotic isolation (&apos;species&apos; term, p = &lt; 0.0001). Thus, S.<lb/> cerevisiae is choosier than S. paradoxus. In addition, the<lb/> data showed that across species, prezygotic isolation<lb/> tended to be stronger in allopatric as compared to sympat-<lb/>ric matings. However, this effect was not statistically sig-<lb/>nificant (&apos;locality&apos; term, p = 0.07). Finally, the analysis<lb/> showed that both species were similar in the change in<lb/> discrimination between sympatric and allopatric individ-<lb/>uals of the other species (interaction term, p = 0.93).<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Closely related Saccharomyces species show prezygotic<lb/> reproductive isolation<lb/></head>

			<p>We have demonstrated that the closely related species S.<lb/> cerevisiae and S. paradoxus show lower levels of interspecific<lb/> hybridisation than would be expected if mating between<lb/> the two were random with respect to species. To our knowl-<lb/>edge this is the first time that prezygotic reproductive isola-<lb/>tion has been demonstrated between Saccharomyces yeast<lb/> species. A previous report by Murphy et al <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> using simi-<lb/>lar mate choice trials showed that when S. cerevisiae occu-<lb/>pied the role of chooser interspecific mating was lower than<lb/> expected by random mating. However Murphy et al <ref type="biblio">[15]<lb/></ref> did not find prezygotic isolation because the result was<lb/> reversed when S. paradoxus was chooser – when offered a<lb/> choice S. paradoxus preferentially mated with S. cerevisiae<lb/> individuals, producing more hybrids than expected by<lb/> chance. This effect was caused by differences in mating pro-<lb/>pensity – S. cerevisiae haploid vegetative cells were both<lb/> faster maters and more likely to mate than S. paradoxus<lb/> cells. Thus mating tended to occur with the partner that was<lb/> more willing to mate, regardless of its species. This meant<lb/> that any prezygotic isolation was undetectable because it<lb/> was obscured by the large difference in mating propensity.<lb/></p>

			<p>The protocol of Murphy et al <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> used strains that had<lb/> been genetically modified to grow as stable clones of veg-<lb/>etative gametes. This meant that only the fusion element<lb/> of the mating process was tested. In nature, yeast gametes<lb/> probably only exist immediately after spore germination,<lb/> so we used spores, rather than vegetatively-growing gam-<lb/>etes, in our assay, so that the whole mating process could<lb/> be tested. Murphy et al <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> kindly provided us with sam-<lb/>ples of the ancestors of their strains, and in our assay we<lb/> were able to detect significant prezygotic reproductive iso-<lb/>lation between them (pairings 4 and 5), as well as<lb/> between species in the other three pairs tested (pairings 1,<lb/> 2, and 3). Our results can only be explained by the pres-<lb/>ence of prezygotic reproductive isolation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Nevertheless we were still interested in whether the<lb/> strength (but not the direction) of the measured prezygotic<lb/> isolation was confounded by differences in mating propen-<lb/>sity. Unlike Murphy et al <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>, we detected no differences<lb/> in mating propensity between the strains in each pair, but<lb/> we had limited power to detect small differences. We did,<lb/> however, determine that hybrids were formed less often<lb/> when S. cerevisiae was chooser than when S. paradoxus was<lb/> chooser. This observation could be caused by S. cerevisiae<lb/> having stronger preference for members of its own species<lb/> than S. paradoxus., i.e. S. cerevisiae is choosier. Mating with<lb/> the wrong species is equally bad for either species, so it is<lb/> not immediately obvious how such a difference in choosi-<lb/>ness might evolve. One possibility is that the barrier<lb/> evolved in S. cerevisiae to prevent mating with another yeast<lb/> species more frequently encountered than S. paradoxus (the<lb/> barrier not providing complete prezygotic reproductive iso-<lb/>lation between the two species studied here). However,<lb/> another explanation, consistent with Murphy et al. <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>, is<lb/> that the difference is caused by a greater mating propensity<lb/> in S. cerevisiae than in S. paradoxus, perhaps reflecting some<lb/> difference in the evolution of these two species.<lb/></p>

			<p>How strong is prezygotic reproductive isolation in yeast?<lb/> Whilst hybrids form readily when no member of the same<lb/> species is present, our results show that many strains<lb/> (especially S. cerevisiae) have near perfect discrimination<lb/> when given choice of species, and hybrids only occur in<lb/> the 33% of matings in which no choice is available (see<lb/> <ref type="figure">Fig 1 and</ref> Results). Clearly, this ability could be important<lb/> for yeast in its natural environment. It is impossible, given<lb/> our current lack of knowledge of wild yeast ecology, to say<lb/> how often the situation of only three spores being in iso-<lb/>lated contact (as in our mate trials) occurs in its natural<lb/> environment. Due to the nature of the yeast tetrad it is<lb/> highly likely that a gamete will usually find itself in close<lb/> proximity to another gamete originating from the same<lb/> tetrad. But the digestion of yeast tetrads by insect vectors<lb/> releases spores from their tetrads, increasing inter-tetrad<lb/> mating <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>. Insects that feed on different yeast species are<lb/> therefore likely to increase the possibility of hybridisation<lb/> between different yeast species <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. These mate choice tri-<lb/>als have allowed us to demonstrate that mating behaviour<lb/> can reduce hybridisation in Saccharomyces species.<lb/></p>

			<p>One caveat that must be noted is that we have only looked<lb/> into the level of hybridisation between S. cerevisiae and S.<lb/> paradoxus isolates but not between strains of the same spe-<lb/>cies. It is possible that variation in the traits that result in<lb/> the prezygotic isolation between species may also result in<lb/> varying levels of hybridisation between different isolates<lb/> of the same species. Within species variation would be an<lb/> interesting avenue for further investigation, especially<lb/> between genetically distinct strains such as the geographi-<lb/>cally isolated S. paradoxus &quot;groups&quot; identified by Kuehne<lb/> et al <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref> and Koufopanou et al <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Did prezygotic reproductive isolation evolve by direct<lb/> selection?<lb/></head>

			<p>Though we have demonstrated that these two species<lb/> show reduced levels of hybridisation we are not able to<lb/> say how or why it evolved. There are two possibilities. The<lb/> first is that natural selection has acted directly to reduce<lb/> the costly formation of sterile hybrids. The second is that<lb/> the prezygotic isolation is an indirect consequence of evo-<lb/>lution, whether by selection on another trait, or by genetic<lb/> drift, that happens to result in reduced hybridisation. A<lb/> laboratory study has already shown that prezygotic isola-<lb/>tion can evolve quickly between Saccharomyces in direct<lb/> response to selection against hybrids <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>. We also know<lb/> that the two species are likely to encounter each other in<lb/> nature: strains of these two species can be isolated from<lb/> the same trees <ref type="biblio">[10,18]</ref> and the two species exhibit very<lb/> similar phenotypic profiles <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>One way to address whether prezygotic isolation evolved<lb/> by direct selection is to compare the strength of isolation in<lb/> sympatric and allopatric species pairs. Sympatric pairs are<lb/> likely to interact more frequently than allopatric pairs, so if<lb/> prezygotic reproductive isolation evolved to reinforce the<lb/> species barrier it should be stronger in sympatric pairs than<lb/> in allopatric pairs. Coyne and Orr have shown this to be<lb/> true for a large number of Drosophila species pairs [<ref type="biblio">[25,26]</ref>,<lb/> for review see <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>]. In our assay we found that prezygotic<lb/> reproductive isolation was stronger in the three sympatric<lb/> species pairs than in the two allopatric species pairs; how-<lb/>ever the difference was not statistically significant. But with<lb/> only five pairs we have little statistical power and we antic-<lb/>ipate that a larger study may well find a strong effect of<lb/> sympatry on prezygotic reproductive isolation. Further, we<lb/> note that the members of the two pairs we designated as<lb/> allopatric do share the same continent, and recent work<lb/> has shown that yeast populations inhabiting the same con-<lb/>tinent recombine freely <ref type="biblio">[11,23]</ref>. Dispersal between conti-<lb/>nents appears to be very low, so it would be very interesting<lb/> to measure prezygotic reproductive isolation (if any)<lb/> between yeast species isolated from different continents.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Possible prezygotic reproductive isolation barriers in yeast<lb/></head>

			<p>There has been considerable debate over whether postzy-<lb/>gotic or prezygotic reproductive isolation barriers are most<lb/> important in maintaining distinct species <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. As prezygotic<lb/> barriers act earlier the general consensus is that they repre-<lb/>sent a stronger barrier to gene flow between populations. If<lb/> no mating actually occurs in the first place genes cannot be<lb/> exchanged between species <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. In nature species pairs often<lb/> exhibit both prezygotic and postzygotic barriers which over<lb/> time have accumulated to reproductively isolate the popu-<lb/>lations. It is however extremely hard to determine which<lb/> barrier evolved first to start the speciation process <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeasts are known to be<lb/> strongly postzygotically isolated from one another <ref type="biblio">[7-9]</ref>.<lb/> The prezygotic reproductive isolation identified here<lb/> could represent a &quot;work in progress&quot;, with the two species<lb/> still undergoing selection and evolution towards less<lb/> &quot;leaky&quot; barriers to hybridisation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Several parts of the yeast life cycle can possibly act as<lb/> prezygotic barriers to stop, or reduce, hybridisation. One<lb/> possible barrier that is analogous to mate selection mech-<lb/>anisms in many higher organisms is pheromone recogni-<lb/>tion <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. If each Saccharomyces species is able to identify<lb/> members of its own species by the pheromone it pro-<lb/>duces, avoiding hybridisation may be possible. This how-<lb/>ever seems unlikely to be the case as the peptide sequence<lb/> of the pheromone is conserved across the Saccharomyces<lb/> sensu stricto species <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>. Differences in mating kinetics<lb/> have been previously highlighted as a possible premating<lb/> barrier between Saccharomyces species. Leu et al <ref type="biblio">[16]<lb/></ref> showed experimentally that S. cerevisiae could evolve to<lb/> avoid mating with strains that would generate lethal com-<lb/>binations of genetic markers in the progeny. The reduc-<lb/>tion in harmful matings evolved because of changes in the<lb/> speed of mating, with faster maters mating with other<lb/> compatible fast maters, slow maters mating with other<lb/> compatible slow maters, thus reducing harmful mating.<lb/> Murphy et al <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> proposed that a similar mechanism<lb/> might work for wild yeast. They found that S. cerevisiae<lb/> strains had a higher mating propensity than the S. para-<lb/>doxus strains used in their experiments. They postulated<lb/> that as S. cerevisiae was more willing to mate and did so<lb/> quicker it would be possible that in certain natural situa-<lb/>tions all the fast and willing maters of one species could<lb/> mate together and all the slow and unwilling maters could<lb/> mate together, reducing the rate of hybrid formation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The spores that we used, unlike vegetative haploid cells,<lb/> are dormant and do not produce pheromone making<lb/> them effectively invisible to gametes actively seeking a<lb/> mate. Vegetative yeast gametes up regulate the production<lb/> of pheromone early in the mating response. As yeast select<lb/> partners on the strength of the pheromone signal they<lb/> produce, S. paradoxus is more likely to choose the display-<lb/>ing S. cerevisiae as a mate (which being faster up regulates<lb/> pheromone quicker) <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. This explains the asymmetric<lb/> mating preference observed by Murphy et al <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> in their<lb/> vegetative cell assays. When spores are used, if one species<lb/> germinates quickly and begins to mate before the other<lb/> species has germinated hybridisation can be reduced. For<lb/> example if S. cerevisiae is a faster germinator than S. para-<lb/>doxus in a S. paradoxus &quot;choosing&quot; mate choice trial the S.<lb/> cerevisiae spore germinates first and will not sense any<lb/> pheromone. The now metabolically active S. cerevisiae cell<lb/> will enter the cell cycle and begin vegetative asexual<lb/> growth, preventing it from mating until it has divided (~2<lb/> h). If, during this time, the S. paradoxus cells germinate,<lb/> they will be more likely to mate with their own species. As<lb/> the majority of wild yeast are homothallic this may be par-<lb/>ticularly important because an unmated fast-germinating<lb/> individual is also likely to undergo mating-type switching<lb/> and subsequently mate with its own daughter cell, elimi-<lb/>nating it from the pool of potential mates. We propose,<lb/> therefore, that spore germination is an important prezy-<lb/>gotic barrier that has previously been overlooked in yeast.<lb/></p>

			<p>Due to the length of time speciation takes to evolve<lb/> between species it is likely that, through selection, many<lb/> isolating barriers can evolve simultaneously <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. Single<lb/> isolating barriers can be &quot;leaky&quot; allowing for some hybrid-<lb/>isation between populations, whereas multiple prezygotic<lb/> barriers working in unison can act to reduce hybridisation<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. A combination of isolating barriers may be involved<lb/> in the observed prezygotic reproductive isolation between<lb/> Saccharomyces species. By developing the methods out-<lb/>lined here as well as those previously reported by Murphy<lb/> et al <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> it may be possible to tease apart the relative<lb/> importance of all parts of the Saccharomyces life cycle as<lb/> they affect reproductive isolation.<lb/></p>

			<head level="1">Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>We have shown for the first time that the two closely<lb/> related (and often sympatric) yeast species S. cerevisiae<lb/> and S. paradoxus are prezygotically reproductively iso-<lb/>lated. Because hybrids are sexually sterile, the ability to<lb/> mate with the correct species could be an adaptation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our results contrast with those of an earlier study <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref> that<lb/> failed to detect prezygotic isolation between vegetative<lb/> gametes from different species. Mating in wild yeast is<lb/> most likely to take place between newly germinated<lb/> spores, so differences in germination may allow the evo-<lb/>lution of prezygotic isolation barriers. With greater knowl-<lb/>edge of yeast life history, in particular exactly when in the<lb/> life cycle mating typically occurs, we will be able to more<lb/> fully understand the contribution of differences in germi-<lb/>nation and mating kinetics to reproductive isolation in<lb/> the wild. Clearly it is desirable that further experiments be<lb/> carried out to expand our knowledge of this important<lb/> model organism in its natural environment.<lb/></p>

			<head level="1">Methods<lb/></head> 
			
			<head level="2">Strains, media and growth conditions<lb/></head>

			<p>A list of the strains used in this work can be found in <ref type="table">Table<lb/> 1</ref>. All strains were wild-type and unmodified from their<lb/> original ancestral type. Strains were sporulated on potas-<lb/>sium acetate plates (2% potassium acetate, 0.22% yeast<lb/> extract, 0.05% glucose, 0.087% complete amino acid mix,<lb/> 2.5% agar) for 4 days at 25°C. Mate choice assays were<lb/> conducted on YEPD plates (1% yeast extract, 2% bac-<lb/>topeptone, 2% glucose, 2.5% agar) at 30°C.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Mate choice assays<lb/></head>

			<p>The ascus containing the yeast spores was digested using a<lb/> standard zymolyase protocol <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>. Using a tetrad dissec-<lb/>tion microscope, two spores of the chooser species were<lb/> taken from separate tetrads and placed in contact with each<lb/> other and a third spore of the other species on a YEPD plate<lb/> (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). This allowed the chooser strain the possibility<lb/> of mating with a member of its own species or another spe-<lb/>cies. All spores used came from different tetrads.<lb/></p>

			<p>After incubation, unmated individuals were removed and<lb/> zygotes left in place. If the removed individual was found<lb/> to have been inviable the test was ignored because no<lb/> choice of mate was possible. Two forms of triad were used:<lb/> one in which the S. cerevisiae strain was chooser and the<lb/> other with S. paradoxus as chooser. This allowed the level<lb/> of reproductive isolation of both species to be investigated.<lb/> 8 mating type combinations are possible when two spores<lb/> from one species are paired with one from another (<ref type="figure">Fig.<lb/> 1</ref>). Of these 8 possibilities, 4 can provide information on<lb/> mate choice between Saccharomyces species (dashed box).<lb/> These four contain both an a and α spore from the chooser<lb/> species and a spore of the other species of either mating<lb/> type. When this occurs a chooser strain cell has a choice of<lb/> mate. The remaining possible combinations provide no<lb/> useful information. Two (solid box) represent triads where<lb/> mating occurs but there is no possibility for mate choice<lb/> between species. Only hybrids can be formed by mating<lb/> within such triads. The remaining two possible combina-<lb/>tions (dotted box) are those where all individuals within a<lb/> triad are of the same mating type and unable to mate.<lb/></p>

			<p>If there is no preferential mating between the species, 2/3<lb/> of the zygotes will be hybrid. This is because 1/3 of all<lb/> matings will always produce hybrids (solid box, <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>)<lb/> and if there is no preference 1/2 of the informative triads<lb/> (2/3 – dashed box, <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>) will produce hybrid zygotes (1/<lb/> 3 + (1/2 × 2/3) = 2/3). If, when offered choice, a spore<lb/> always mates with its own species 1/3 of zygotes will be<lb/> hybrid. Alternatively, if when presented with a choice of<lb/> mate a cell always chooses to mate with a member of<lb/> another species, all zygotes will be hybrid. Prezygotic iso-<lb/>lation can therefore be measured by deviation from the<lb/> proportion of interspecific matings expected if no prefer-<lb/>ence exists (2/3).<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">DNA extraction and PCR identification of hybrids<lb/></head>

			<p>Matings are identified as being interspecific or intraspe-<lb/>cific by species specific PCR. DNA was extracted from the<lb/> colonies formed by each mating using a glass bead<lb/> method <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Species specific primers were designed that only produce<lb/> an amplicon if the genome of a particular species is<lb/> present as a template. The primers were designed by align-<lb/>ing the reference genomes for the two species using the<lb/> fungal alignment viewer provided by the Saccharomyces<lb/> Genome Database <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>. Different amplicon lengths were<lb/> used for each species. S. cerevisiae primers produced an<lb/> amplicon of approximately 500 bp whilst those for S. par-<lb/>adoxus amplified approximately 300 bp of DNA. This sim-<lb/>ple design feature allowed for the quick and easy<lb/> determination of hybrids and allowed us to control for<lb/> the accidental use of an incorrect primer by contamina-<lb/>tion. Two sets of species specific PCR primers that amplify<lb/> a different region of the particular species genome were<lb/> used for each zygote to allow confirmation of results.<lb/> Some species specific primers did not work with some<lb/> strains of the correct species, presumably because the<lb/> sequence at a primer site was polymorphic. New primers<lb/> were designed in these cases. See Additional file 1: PCR<lb/> primer sequences for the sequences of the primers and the<lb/> strain pairs with which they were used.</p>
