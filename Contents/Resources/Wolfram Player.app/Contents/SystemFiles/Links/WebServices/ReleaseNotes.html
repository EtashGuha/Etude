<h2><i>Web Services</i> 1.0 Release Notes</h2>


Welcome to <i>Web Services</i>, version 1.0.
<p>
Web services is an emerging technology that provides programmatic interfaces on the network that are used for application to application communication.
Web services allow users to integrate code from most platforms or languages with their application. The Web Services Package is a <i>Mathematica</i> Package
that integrates <i>Mathematica</i> and web services by letting a user call web services from <i>Mathematica</i> in a completely transparent way. <i>Mathematica</i> users
can dynamically access new data and functionality located on the network. The Web Services Package makes the whole universe of existing and future web
services an automatic extension to the <i>Mathematica</i> environment.
<p>
<i>Web Services</i> runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and UNIX.

<h3>Changes in version 1.0.2 </h3>
<p>Moved $WebServicesSecurityInitialized symbol into the package context.</p>

<h3>Changes in version 1.0.1 </h3>
<p>A bug was fixed in the XML parser that affected how the WSDL file was parsed within
InstallService.  This bug was common in web services implemented in .Net.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug in Deserialize that forced an ugly message and forced deserialization to fail.
The problem occurred when a data type definition was not found.  Data will be converted
generically if a data type definition is not found.  Simple data will become a string
and complex data will become a rule.</p>
<p>Updated the Wolfram Search example to use Wolfram Search version 2.</p>

<h3>Changes in version 1.0.0 </h3>
<p>Reorganized the package. This includes where some of the file are located and how
the code loads.  This fixes some problems with symbols clashing with other symbols.</p>
<p>Updated the TerraService example to use GUIKit.</p>
<p>Added Web Services Navigator example.</p>

<h3>Changes in version 1.0.0b3 </h3>
<p>Fixed the semantics for using MathML with Web Services.  The client will support
sending MathML when a type is specified as math.type rather than just supporting
a math element defined in the MathML Schema.</p>
<p>Fixed the semantics for using Expressions with Web Services.  The client will support
sending Expressions when a type is specified as Expression rather than just supporting
a Expression element defined in the MathML Schema.</p>
<p>Updated Amazon examples to version 3.  Version 1 is going offline.</p>

<h3>Changes in version 1.0.0b2 </h3>
<p>Added support for ExpressionML.  If a web service returns ExpressionML, the client will transform the data
into an Expression automatically for the user.</p>
<p>Added InsecureExprQ function that helps ensure ExpressionML that is converted by the client is safe.  A
user used SetSecurity to specify allowed and disallowed symbols and contexts.  This function returns True
if a symbol is disallowed.</p>
<p>Added SetSecurity function that is used to specify which symbols and contexts are allowed and disallowed by
InsecureExprQ.</p>
<p>Added ExpressionWrapperFunction option that allows the user to specify a function that will wrap each
Expression that is created with ExpressionML returned from a web service operation.  One use of this option
is it provides the users with a way to use Hold on a Expression before it is evaluated.</p>
<p>Added support for MathML.  If a web service returns MathML, the client will transform the data
into Symbolic XML automatically for the user.</p>
<p>Removed support for the HeaderEncodingStyleURI option.  Headers will use the encoding style used by the body.
HeaderEncodingStyleURI did not scale properly as there could be multiple headers each with different
encoding styles.  Yet there was only one HeaderEncodingStyleURI option.  WS-I profiles specifies that
only literal encoding should be used.  So really this should be the standard and there should be no need to
specify the headers encoding style URI.  However, encoding may still be used for the client, but only if the
encoding matches the body's encoding.</p>
<p>Added DeencodeParameters option that is mostly an internal option.  Parameters are encoded with their type
and arrayType in order to identify the type and arrayType of parameters at runtime.  For SOAP encoded messages,
this is useful because these are required within the message.  However, literal messages do not require
these encodings to be in the message and they should not be sent to the service as it may cause iteroperability
problems.  Therefor the encodings must be removed after the types and arrayTypes are identified by the code
building the message.  By setting this option to True, the encodings are removed.  By setting the option to
False the encodings remain for messages that are SOAP encoded.  This option is exposed to the user, as it may
be useful while building a function using InstallServiceOperation.</p>
<p>Added support the elementFormDefault attribute in XML Schema definitions.  Previous versions of the Web
Services package were ignoring this attribute and not building messages correctly.  For previous versions,
if a service was document-style it used qualified elements, but if it rpc-style it used unqualified elements.
</p>
<p>Fixed support for importing schema.  Previous versions were not importing schema defined in the types
section correctly.  This should be fixed.</p>

<h3>Changes in version 1.0.0b1 </h3>
Initial Release.

<h3>Known issues in this release </h3>
<p>
  <b>XML Schema</b>
</p>
<p>
  The entire XML Schema specification is not supported.  There will be complex
  schema type definitions which will not work properly.  This can be overcome by
  building the requests by hand using ToServiceRequest.  More schema support will
  be added in the next version.
</p>
<p>
  <b>HTTP Requests</b>
</p>
<p>
  Timeouts may occur only after a lengthy wait.  This occurs because the Java libraries
  that are used to make the HTTP requests only allow for the server to determine when the
  timeout occurs.  So the client may wait for a longer period waiting than intended, waiting
  for the server to timeout.  This will hopefully be addressed in future releases.
