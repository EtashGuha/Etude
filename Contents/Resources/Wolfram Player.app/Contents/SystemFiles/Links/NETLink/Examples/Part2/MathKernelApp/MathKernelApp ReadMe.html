<H2><EM>.NET/Link</EM> Example: MathKernel Demo</H2>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This example demonstrates the <EM>.NET/Link</EM> MathKernel component, which provides a 
very high-level interface for using <EM>Mathematica</EM> from .NET programs.</P>
<P>The MathKernel class is especially suited to visual programming environments, as it is 
highly configurable via properties. This example includes&nbsp;the Visual Studio .NET
solution file that was used to create it. You can open it in Visual Studio and inspect it, 
modify it, etc.</P>
<P>The only code that was written by hand in this program is the computeButton_Click method 
at the end of the Form1.cs file. As you can see, we only needed to write a few 
lines of code to create this entire program.</P>
<P>
More documentation about the methods and properties of the MathKernel class is available in 
the <a href="../../../Documentation/apidocs/index.html">.NET/Link API Documentation</a>.
