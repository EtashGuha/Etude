</div>

<div id="nstext"><p><EM>.NET/Link</EM> is a toolkit that integrates the Wolfram Language and
.NET. It allows you to call .NET from the Wolfram Language and call the Wolfram Language from
.NET.
</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H4 class="dtH4">Calling .NET From the Wolfram Language</H4>
<P><EM>.NET/Link</EM> allows Wolfram Language programmers to load arbitrary .NET types into the Wolfram Language,
create objects of these types, call methods and properties, and so on. You can, in effect,
"script" .NET from the Wolfram Language. This powerful capability literally makes all of .NET
accessible directly from the Wolfram Language and allows&nbsp;exciting new
categories of Wolfram Language programs to be created, incuding&nbsp;creating user
interfaces, controlling COM objects like Microsoft Office, interacting directly with the
Windows operating system, and many others.</P>
<P>Calling .NET from the Wolfram Language is documented in Part 1 of&nbsp;the <EM>.NET/Link</EM>
User Guide. The help file you are currently reading will not be of much value, as it describes the <EM>
.NET/Link</EM> API as seen by .NET programmers, not Wolfram Language programmers. It can
still be useful for Wolfram Language programmers who want to use one of the <EM>.NET/Link</EM>
classes that are designed to be used from the Wolfram Language, such as the <A href="Wolfram.NETLink.UI.MathPictureBox.html">
MathPictureBox</A> class.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h4 class="dtH4">Calling the Wolfram Language from .NET</h4>
<p><EM>.NET/Link</EM> allows programmers writing in any .NET language, such as C#&nbsp;or
Visual Basic .NET, to launch the Wolfram System and use it as a computational engine. This
help file describes the <EM>.NET/Link</EM> API that .NET programmers will use to interact with the Wolfram Language.
</p>
<P>A good place to start is the <A href="Wolfram.NETLink.IKernelLink.html">IKernelLink</A>&nbsp;interface.
You will find a simple example program there. IKernelLink is the link interface that most
programmers will use.</P>
<P>You should also look at the <A href="Wolfram.NETLink.MathKernel.html">MathKernel</A>&nbsp;class.
This component provides a very high-level interface for interacting with the Wolfram Language.
It is especially intended for use in visual programming environments, as it is highly
configurable via properties. It is especially useful for programs that want to capture not just
the result of a computation, but also messages, Print output, or graphics generated as side
effects of the computation.</P>
<P>
There are example programs in the <EM>.NET/Link</EM> examples directory: <FONT face="Courier New">&lt;Wolfram
dir&gt;\SystemFiles\Links\NETLink\Examples\Part2</FONT>.</P>
<P>There is more documentation for .NET programmers in the <EM>.NET/Link</EM> User Guide. Part 2 of the
User Guide describes writing .NET programs that call the Wolfram Language, and it treats
various topics in <EM>.NET/Link</EM> programming. The present help file is the API-level
documentation.</P>
<P><EM>.NET/Link</EM> consists of&nbsp;a single assembly, Wolfram.NETLink.dll. The Wolfram System installer creates a special registry key that allows the
Wolfram.NETLink assembly to automatically appear in the Visual Studio "Add Reference" dialog.
